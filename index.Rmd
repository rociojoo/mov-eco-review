## Abstract of the manuscript

Movement is fundamental to life, shaping population dynamics,
biodiversity patterns and ecosystem structure. 
In 2008, the Movement Ecology Framework (MEF, Nathan et al. 2008)
introduced an integrative theory of organism movement—linking internal
state, motion capacity and navigation capacity to external factors—which 
has been recognized as a milestone in the field.
Since, 
the study of movement
experienced a technological boom, providing massive quantities of tracking data
globally of both
animal and human movement at ever finer spatio-temporal resolutions.
In this work, we provide a quantitative assessment of the state 
of research in animal and human movement under the MEF.  
Using a text mining approach, we reviewed >8000 papers, identified 
tools and methods, and assessed all components of the MEF. 
Over the past decade, the publication rate has increased considerably, along
with major technological changes, such as an increased use of GPS devices and
accelerometers, and a convergence towards the R
software.  
However, research, particularly in animals, 
still largely focuses on the effect of environmental factors on movement, 
with much less focus on motion and navigation.  
We discuss the potential for the technological and methodological advances in the field 
to lead to more integrated and interdisciplinary research and the exploration of
key movement processes like navigation, and evolutionary, physiological
and life-history consequences of movement.
