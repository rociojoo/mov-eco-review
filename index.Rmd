This is the companion website for the manuscript “Recent trends in movement ecology of animals and human mobility”,
a quantitative review of animal and human movement literature in 2009-2018 from Joo et al., serving as the manuscript's supplementary information page. The R codes for the analyses are available in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/rociojoo/mov-eco-review).

## Abstract of the manuscript

  Movement is fundamental to life, shaping population dynamics, biodiversity
  patterns and ecosystem structure.  In 2008, the Movement Ecology Framework
  (MEF; Nathan et al. 2008) introduced an integrative theory of organism
  movement—linking internal state, motion capacity, and navigation capacity to
  external factors—which has been recognized as a milestone in the field.
  Since then, the study of movement experienced a technological boom, which provided
  massive quantities of tracking data of both animal and human movement globally and
  at ever finer spatio-temporal resolutions. In this work, we provide a
  quantitative assessment of the state of research within the MEF, focusing on 
  animal movement, including humans and invertebrates, and excluding movement
  of plants and microorganisms. Using a text mining approach, 
  we digitally scanned the content of >8000 papers
  from 2009-2018 available online,
  identified tools and methods, and assessed all components of the MEF. Over
  the past decade, the publication rate has increased considerably, along with
  major technological changes, such as an increased use of GPS devices and
  accelerometers and a majority of studies now using the 
  R software environment for statistical computing. However, animal movement 
  research still largely focuses on the effect of environmental
  factors on movement, with much less focus on motion and navigation. We
  discuss the potential for technological and methodological advances in the
  field to lead to more integrated and interdisciplinary research and increased
  exploration of key movement processes like navigation and the evolutionary,
  physiological, and life-history consequences of movement.
