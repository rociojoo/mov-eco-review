## Abstract of the manuscript

Movement is fundamental to life, shaping population dynamics, biodiversity 
patterns, and ecosystem structure.
It has been studied for millenia from different perspectives, diversifying into 
several research fields like physics, physiology, data science, and ecology.
Around a decade ago, the movement ecology framework (MEF), an integrative framework for movement studies, was developed. It required more integrative interdisciplinary research to understand the processes behind movement.
In parallel, recent advances in tracking technology have enabled tagging individuals from a large diversity of species and taxa globally, and collecting data at ever finer spatio-temporal resolutions. 
Here, a decade later, we investigated the current state of research in the field.
Using a text mining approach on \> 8000 peer-reviewed
papers in movement ecology, we explored the main research topics,
and assessed changes in the study of the movement components described in the MEF, the use of technological devices, software and statistical methods. 
The number of publications has increased considerably and there have been major technological changes in the past decade (i.e. increased use of GPS devices, accelerometers and video cameras, and a convergence towards R), yet we found that research focuses on the same questions, like the effect of environmental factors on
movement, and overall neglects the study of movement processes. 
We call on researchers to transform the field from technology-driven to embrace interdisciplinary collaboration, in order to reveal key processes
underlying movement (e.g. navigation), as well as evolutionary, physiological
and life-history consequences of particular strategies.
