1,101111oik05276,"Individuals vary greatly in the distance they disperse, and in doing so, strongly affect ecological and evolutionary processes. Dispersal, when viewed as a component of phenotype, can be affected independently or jointly by environment. However, among taxa with complex life cycles that occupy different habitats over ontogeny, the effects of environment on dispersal and the interaction between environment and phenotype remains poorly understood. Here, we conducted a field experiment to measure how dispersal distance was affected by phenotype, environment experienced before and after metamorphosis, and their interaction. We manipulated the environment encountered by a pond-breeding salamander Ambystoma annulatum during the aquatic larval stage and again as dispersing terrestrial juveniles. After assaying juvenile phenotype (exploration behavior, body condition, and morphology), we then measured the initial distance dispersed by juveniles. The distance moved by dispersing salamanders was affected by attributes of both larval and juvenile habitat, with salamanders that encountered low quality habitat in either life stage moving the farthest. However, we did not find support for an interactive effect of phenotype and environment affecting the distance moved by dispersers. Interestingly, exploration behavior explained the distance moved by philopatric animals but not dispersing ones. Our findings indicate that the environment experienced before metamorphosis can affect juvenile dispersal behavior, and demonstrates the need to consider dispersal in species with complex life cycles to understand the coupling between local and regional population dynamics.",0.9949599217131847,3.600055925687836e-4,3.600055917806832e-4,3.600055923963188e-4,3.6000559167926314e-4,3.6000559156097197e-4,3.600055918340911e-4,3.600055920199473e-4,3.6000559154737076e-4,3.600055922990232e-4,3.6000559150848417e-4,3.60005591763497e-4,3.600055928658019e-4,3.60005591674573e-4,3.600055913164939e-4
1,1011111365265612315,"Movement and dispersal are critical processes for almost all organisms in natural populations. Understanding their causes and consequences is therefore of high interest. While both theoretical and empirical work suggest that dispersal, more exactly emigration, is plastic and may be a function of local population density, the functional relationship between the underlying movement strategies and population density has received less attention. We here present evidence for the shape of this reaction norm and are able to differentiate between three possible cues: the relative number of individuals, the presence of metabolites (chemical cues) and resource availability. We performed microcosm experiments with the ciliate model organism Tetrahymena in order to understand the plasticity of movement strategies with respect to local density while controlling for possible confounding effects mediated by the availability of different cues. In addition, we investigated how an Allee effect can influence movement and dispersal plasticity. Our findings suggest that movement strategies in Tetrahymena are plastic and density-dependent. The observed movement reaction norm was U-shaped. This may be due to an Allee effect which led to negative density dependence at low population densities and generally positive density dependence at high population densities due to local competition. This possibly adaptive density-dependent movement strategy was likely mediated by chemical cues. Our experimental work in highly controlled conditions indicates that both environmental cues as well as inherent population dynamics must be considered to understand movement and dispersal.",0.9947969304569936,3.716478245210015e-4,3.7164782470936955e-4,3.7164782442779113e-4,3.7164782441392267e-4,3.71647824312561e-4,3.716478246820374e-4,3.716478248235197e-4,3.716478245155728e-4,3.716478247453826e-4,3.716478243551595e-4,3.7164782439285353e-4,3.716478245208429e-4,3.716478242787462e-4,3.716478243075961e-4
1,101098rspb20132851,"Dispersal is not a blind process, and evidence is accumulating that individual dispersal strategies are informed in most, if not all, organisms. The acquisition and use of information are traits that may evolve across space and time as a function of the balance between costs and benefits of informed dispersal. If information is available, individuals can potentially use it in making better decisions, thereby increasing their fitness. However, prospecting for and using information probably entail costs that may constrain the evolution of informed dispersal, potentially with population-level consequences. By using individual-based, spatially explicit simulations, we detected clear coevolutionary dynamics between prospecting and dispersal movement strategies that differed in sign and magnitude depending on their respective costs. More specifically, we found that informed dispersal strategies evolve when the costs of information acquisition during prospecting are low but only if there are mortality costs associated with dispersal movements. That is, selection favours informed dispersal strategies when the acquisition and use processes themselves were not too expensive. When non-informed dispersal strategies evolve, they do so jointly with the evolution of long dispersal distance because this maximizes the sampling area. In some cases, selection produces dispersal rules different from those that would be 'optimal' (i.e. the best possible population performance-in our context quantitatively measured as population density and patch occupancy-among all possible individual movement rules) for the population. That is, on the one hand, informed dispersal strategies led to population performance below its highest possible level. On the other hand, un-and poorly informed individuals nearly optimized population performance, both in terms of density and patch occupancy.",0.9950756175511634,3.5174160407013444e-4,3.5174160453272854e-4,3.5174160355008033e-4,3.517416035631244e-4,3.517416033048993e-4,3.517416033328953e-4,3.517416034615724e-4,0.00035174160317547423,3.517416033848287e-4,3.517416031689595e-4,3.517416029944769e-4,3.5174160314262366e-4,3.517416031542515e-4,3.5174160400067123e-4
1,101111j16000706201120181x,"Population growth can be positively or negatively dependent on density. Therefore, the distribution pattern of individuals in a patchy environment can greatly affect the growth of each subpopulation and thereby of the metapopulation. When population growth presents positive density-dependence (Allee effect), the distribution pattern becomes crucial, as small populations have an increased extinction risk. The way in which individuals move between patches largely determines the distribution pattern and thereby the population dynamics. Collective movement, in particular, should be expected to increase the potential number of colonisers and therefore the probability of colonising success. Here, we use mathematical modelling (differential equations and stochastic simulations) to study how collective movement can influence metapopulation dynamics when Allee effects are at stake. The models are inspired by the two-spotted spider mite, a phytophagous pest of recognised agricultural importance. This sub-social mite displays trail laying/following behaviour that can provoke collective movement. Moreover, experimental evidence suggests that it is subject to Allee effects. In the first part of this study we present a single-species population growth model incorporating Allee effects, and study its properties. In the second part, this growth model is integrated into a larger simulation model consisting of a set of interconnected patches, in which the individuals move from one patch to the other either independently or collectively. Our results show that collective movement is more advantageous than independent dispersal only when Allee effects are present and strong enough. Furthermore they provide a theoretical framework that allows the quantification of the interplay between Allee effects and collective movement.",0.9950376470040754,3.544537850401086e-4,3.544537855886443e-4,3.5445378537205744e-4,3.544537857464738e-4,3.544537857400998e-4,3.5445378547320565e-4,3.5445378565733754e-4,3.5445378524272546e-4,3.5445378507980614e-4,3.544537853914567e-4,3.5445378536642843e-4,3.544537853103769e-4,3.544537850885791e-4,3.5445378582726146e-4
1,101371journalpone0026189,"In group-living animals, such as primates, the average spatial group structure often reflects the dominance hierarchy, with central dominants and peripheral subordinates. This central-peripheral group structure can arise by self-organization as a result of subordinates fleeing from dominants after losing a fight. However, in real primates, subordinates often avoid interactions with potentially aggressive group members, thereby preventing aggression and subsequent fleeing. Using agent-based modeling, we investigated which spatial and encounter structures emerge when subordinates also avoid known potential aggressors at a distance as compared with the model which only included fleeing after losing a fight (fleeing model). A central-peripheral group structure emerged in most conditions. When avoidance was employed at small or intermediate distances, centrality of dominants emerged similar to the fleeing model, but in a more pronounced way. This result was also found when fleeing after a fight was made independent of dominance rank, i.e. occurred randomly. Employing avoidance at larger distances yielded more spread out groups. This provides a possible explanation of larger group spread in more aggressive species. With avoidance at very large distances, spatially and socially distinct subgroups emerged. We also investigated how encounters were distributed amongst group members. In the fleeing model all individuals encountered all group members equally often, whereas in the avoidance model encounters occurred mostly among similar-ranking individuals. Finally, we also identified a very general and simple mechanism causing a central-peripheral group structure: when individuals merely differed in velocity, faster individuals automatically ended up at the periphery. In summary, a central-peripheral group pattern can easily emerge from individual variation in different movement properties in general, such as fleeing, avoidance or velocity. Moreover, avoidance behavior also affects the encounter structure and can lead to subgroup formation.",0.9957006663645563,3.0709526032310743e-4,3.070952593697007e-4,3.0709525960754083e-4,3.070952594662563e-4,3.0709525909610266e-4,3.0709525929268933e-4,3.070952607737501e-4,3.0709525946147906e-4,3.0709525982160245e-4,3.0709525937479563e-4,3.0709525913287224e-4,3.0709526116251356e-4,3.070952594048467e-4,3.0709525915643515e-4
2,103390ijgi7070259,"The mobility patterns and trip behavior of people are usually extracted from data collected by traditional survey methods. However, these methods are generally costly and difficult to implement, especially in developing cities with limited resources. The massive amounts of call detail record (CDR) data passively generated by ubiquitous mobile phone usage provide researchers with the opportunity to innovate alternative methods that are inexpensive and easier and faster to implement than traditional methods. This paper proposes a method based on proven techniques to extract the origin-destination (OD) trips from the raw CDR data of mobile phone users and process the data to capture the mobility of those users. The proposed method was applied to 3.4 million mobile phone users over a 12-day period in Mozambique, and the data processed to capture the mobility of people living in the Greater Maputo metropolitan area in different time frames (weekdays and weekends). Subsequently, trip generation maps, attraction maps, and the OD matrix of the study area, which are all practically usable for urban and transportation planning, were generated. Furthermore, spatiotemporal interpolation was applied to all OD trips to reconstruct the population distribution in the study area on an average weekday and weekend. Comparison of the results obtained with actual survey results from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) indicate that the proposed method achieves acceptable accuracy. The proposed method and study demonstrate the efficacy of mining big data sources, particularly mobile phone CDR data, to infer the spatiotemporal human mobility of people in a city and understand their flow pattern, which is valuable information for city planning.",2.4362213077312606e-4,0.9965892901718376,2.4362213089786463e-4,2.4362213080183538e-4,2.4362213101083007e-4,2.4362213080880715e-4,2.4362213052961032e-4,2.4362213038879287e-4,2.4362213048164175e-4,2.4362213054017075e-4,2.4362213038606708e-4,2.436221303170706e-4,2.436221303365526e-4,2.4362213036687843e-4,2.4362213052311866e-4
2,103390ijgi7050177,"Taxi behavior is a spatial-temporal dynamic process involving discrete time dependent events, such as customer pick-up, customer drop-off, cruising, and parking. Simulation models, which are a simplification of a real-world system, can help understand the effects of change of such dynamic behavior. In this paper, agent-based modeling and simulation is proposed, that describes the dynamic action of an agent, i.e., taxi, governed by behavior rules and properties, which emulate the taxi behavior. Taxi behavior simulations are fundamentally done for optimizing the service level for both taxi drivers as well as passengers. Moreover, simulation techniques, as such, could be applied to another field of application as well, where obtaining real raw data are somewhat difficult due to privacy issues, such as human mobility data or call detail record data. This paper describes the development of an agent-based simulation model which is based on multiple input parameters (taxi stay point cluster; trip information (origin and destination); taxi demand information; free taxi movement; and network travel time) that were derived from taxi probe GPS data. As such, agent's parameters were mapped into grid network, and the road network, for which the grid network was used as a base for query/search/retrieval of taxi agent's parameters, while the actual movement of taxi agents was on the road network with routing and interpolation. The results obtained from the simulated taxi agent data and real taxi data showed a significant level of similarity of different taxi behavior, such as trip generation; trip time; trip distance as well as trip occupancy, based on its distribution. As for efficient data handling, a distributed computing platform for large-scale data was used for extracting taxi agent parameter from the probe data by utilizing both spatial and non-spatial indexing technique.",2.7413127823154744e-4,0.9961621621081732,2.741312781814662e-4,2.7413127813035934e-4,2.7413127787867975e-4,2.7413127789774035e-4,2.74131277957368e-4,2.741312781862217e-4,2.7413127783130245e-4,2.741312779729605e-4,2.741312779860184e-4,2.7413127790924065e-4,2.741312779190312e-4,2.74131277971093e-4,2.7413127777379945e-4
2,103141262202,"This paper presents the development of an integrated microscopic mobility simulator, SimMobility Short-Term (ST). The simulator is integrated because its models, inputs and outputs, simulated components, and code base are integrated within a multiscale agent-and activity-based simulation platform capable of simulating different spatiotemporal resolutions and accounting for different levels of travelers' decision making. The simulator is microscopic because both the demand (agents and its trips) and the supply (trip realization and movements on the network) are microscopic (i.e., modeled individually). Finally, the simulator has mobility because it copes with the multimodal nature of urban networks and the need for the flexible simulation of innovative transportation services, such as on-demand and smart mobility solutions. This paper follows previous publications that describe SimMobility's overall framework and models. SimMobility is an open-source, multiscale platform that considers land use, transportation, and mobility-sensitive behavioral models. SimMobility ST aims at simulating the high-resolution movement of agents (traffic, transit, pedestrians, and goods) and the operation of different mobility services and control and information systems. This paper presents the SimMobility ST modeling framework and system architecture and reports on its successful calibration for Singapore and its use in several scenarios of innovative mobility applications. The paper also shows how detailed performance measures from SimMobility ST can be integrated with a daily activity and mobility patterns simulator. Such integration is crucial to model accurately the effect of different technologies and service operations at the urban level, as the identity and preferences of simulated agents are maintained across temporal decision scales, ensuring the consistency and accuracy of simulated accessibility and performance measures of each scenario.",3.091606053175744e-4,0.9956717515298555,3.0916060500383723e-4,3.091606054519445e-4,3.091606046502196e-4,3.09160604564218e-4,3.0916060484673216e-4,3.091606049661901e-4,3.091606047615723e-4,3.091606053843074e-4,3.0916060558027755e-4,3.091606046942283e-4,3.091606051043647e-4,3.091606051785953e-4,3.0916060464037466e-4
2,1011112041210X12196,"1. Many capture-recapture surveys of wildlife populations operate in continuous time, but detections are typically aggregated into occasions for analysis, even when exact detection times are available. This discards information and introduces subjectivity, in the form of decisions about occasion definition.
2. We develop a spatiotemporal Poisson process model for spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) surveys that operate continuously and record exact detection times. We show that, except in some special cases (including the case in which detection probability does not change within occasion), temporally aggregated data do not provide sufficient statistics for density and related parameters, and that when detection probability is constant over time, our continuous-time (CT) model is equivalent to an existing model based on detection frequencies. We use the model to estimate jaguar density from a camera-trap survey and conduct a simulation study to investigate the properties of a CT estimator and discrete-occasion estimators with various levels of temporal aggregation. This includes investigation of the effect on the estimators of spatiotemporal correlation induced by animal movement.
3. The CT estimator is found to be unbiased and more precise than discrete-occasion estimators based on binary capture data (rather than detection frequencies) when there is no spatiotemporal correlation. It is also found to be only slightly biased when there is correlation induced by animal movement, and to be more robust to inadequate detector spacing, while discrete-occasion estimators with binary data can be sensitive to occasion length, particularly in the presence of inadequate detector spacing.
4. Our model includes as a special case a discrete-occasion estimator based on detection frequencies, and at the same time lays a foundation for the development of more sophisticated CT models and estimators. It allows modelling within-occasion changes in detectability, readily accommodates variation in detector effort, removes subjectivity associated with user-defined occasions and fully utilizes CT data. We identify a need for developing CT methods that incorporate spatiotemporal dependence in detections and see potential for CT models being combined with telemetry-based animal movement models to provide a richer inference framework.",2.6774460411927375e-4,0.9962515755460448,2.6774460415022365e-4,2.677446044381228e-4,2.6774460359111566e-4,2.6774460356052354e-4,2.677446039334053e-4,2.677446037011605e-4,2.677446036246071e-4,2.677446039765822e-4,2.677446036379462e-4,2.677446037517519e-4,2.67744604210909e-4,2.6774460362628035e-4,2.677446036332069e-4
2,101111j13652656201101851x,"1. Large data sets containing precise movement data from free-roaming animals are now becoming commonplace. One means of analysing individual movement data is through discrete, random walk-based models.
2. Random walk models are easily modified to incorporate common features of animal movement, and the ways that these modifications affect the scaling of net displacement are well studied. Recently, ecologists have begun to explore more complex statistical models with multiple latent states, each of which are characterized by a distribution of step lengths and have their own unimodal distribution of turning angles centred on one type of turn (e. g. reversals).
3. Here, we introduce the compound wrapped Cauchy distribution, which allows for multimodal distributions of turning angles within a single state. When used as a single state model, the parameters provide a straightforward summary of the relative contributions of different turn types. The compound wrapped Cauchy distribution can also be used to build multiple state models.
4. We hypothesize that a multiple state model with unimodal distributions of turning angles will best describe movement at finer resolutions, while a multiple state model using our multimodal distribution will better describe movement at intermediate temporal resolutions. At coarser temporal resolutions, a single state model using our multimodal distribution should be sufficient. We parameterize and compare the performance of these models at four different temporal resolutions (1, 4, 12 and 24 h) using data from eight individuals of Loxodonta cyclotis and find support for our hypotheses.
5. We assess the efficacy of the different models in extrapolating to coarser temporal resolution by comparing properties of data simulated from the different models to the properties of the observed data. At coarser resolutions, simulated data sets recreate many aspects of the observed data; however, only one of the models accurately predicts step length, and all models underestimate the frequency of reversals.
6. The single state model we introduce may be adequate to describe movement data at many resolutions and can be interpreted easily. Multiscalar analyses of movement such as the ones presented here are a useful means of identifying inconsistencies in our understanding of movement.",2.991026472702233e-4,0.9958125629485874,2.9910264601282514e-4,2.991026466869058e-4,2.99102646962491e-4,2.991026462588429e-4,2.9910264619072526e-4,2.991026457716186e-4,2.9910264597096865e-4,2.9910264672782855e-4,2.991026476431195e-4,2.991026457881974e-4,2.991026460097536e-4,2.991026474692407e-4,2.991026466498108e-4
3,101371journalpone0195480,"Across the boreal forest of Canada, habitat disturbance is the ultimate cause of caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) declines. Habitat restoration is a focus of caribou recovery efforts, with a goal to finding ways to reduce predator use of disturbances, and caribou-predator encounters. One of the most pervasive disturbances within caribou ranges in Alberta, Canada are seismic lines cleared for energy exploration. Seismic lines facilitate predator movement, and although vegetation on some seismic lines is regenerating, it remains unknown whether vegetation regrowth is sufficient to alter predator response. We used Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data, and GPS locations, to understand how vegetation and other attributes of seismic lines influence movements of two predators, wolves (Canis lupus) and grizzly bears (Ursus arctos). During winter, wolves moved towards seismic lines regardless of vegetation height, while during spring wolves moved towards seismic lines with higher vegetation. During summer, wolves moved towards seismic lines with lower vegetation and also moved faster near seismic lines with vegetation <0.7 m. Seismic lines with lower vegetation height were preferred by grizzly bears during spring and summer, but there was no relationship between vegetation height and grizzly bear movement rates. These results suggest that wolves use seismic lines for travel during summer, but during winter wolf movements relative to seismic lines could be influenced by factors additional to movement efficiency; potentially enhanced access to areas frequented by ungulate prey. Grizzly bears may be using seismic lines for movement, but could also be using seismic lines as a source of vegetative food or ungulate prey. To reduce wolf movement rate, restoration could focus on seismic lines with vegetation <1 m in height. However our results revealed that seismic lines continue to influence wolf movement behaviour decades after they were built, and even at later stages of regeneration. Therefore it remains unknown at what stage of natural regeneration, if any, wolves cease to respond to seismic lines. To reduce wolf response to seismic lines, active restoration tactics like blocking seismic lines and tree planting, along with management of alternate prey, could be evaluated.",2.3253100676345063e-4,2.3253100637378267e-4,0.9967445659093547,2.3253100657036568e-4,2.325310065713553e-4,2.3253100629083145e-4,2.3253100649301385e-4,2.3253100631588256e-4,2.3253100636260772e-4,2.325310065670753e-4,2.3253100632656673e-4,2.3253100636581357e-4,2.3253100613401776e-4,2.325310065910359e-4,2.3253100691944393e-4
3,101371journalpone0186525,"Woodland caribou (Rangifertarandus caribou) in Ontario are a threatened species that have experienced a substantial retraction of their historic range. Part of their decline has been attributed to increasing densities of anthropogenic linear features such as trails, roads, railways, and hydro lines. These features have been shown to increase the search efficiency and kill rate of wolves. However, it is unclear whether selection for anthropogenic linear features is additive or compensatory to selection for natural (water) linear features which may also be used for travel. We studied the selection of water and anthropogenic linear features by 52 resident wolves (Canis lupusx lycaon) over four years across three study areas in northern Ontario that varied in degrees of forestry activity and human disturbance. We used Euclidean distance -based resource selection functions (mixed -effects logistic regression) at the seasonal range scale with random coefficients for distance to water linear features, primary/secondary roads/railways, and hydro lines, and tertiary roads to estimate the strength of selection for each linear feature and for several habitat types, while accounting for availability of each feature. Next, we investigated the trade-off between selection for anthropogenic and water linear features. Wolves selected both anthropogenic and water linear features; selection for anthropogenic features was stronger than for water during the rendezvous season. Selection for anthropogenic linear features increased with increasing density of these features on the landscape, while selection for natural linear features declined, indicating compensatory selection of anthropogenic linear features. These results have implications for woodland caribou conservation. Prey encounter rates between wolves and caribou seem to be strongly influenced by increasing linear feature densities. This behavioral mechanism a compensatory functional response to anthropogenic linear feature density resulting in decreased use of natural travel corridors has negative consequences for the viability of woodland caribou.",2.5440846126818914e-4,2.5440846157864225e-4,0.996438281542891,2.5440846129901675e-4,2.5440846142474446e-4,2.5440846133777134e-4,2.544084613619616e-4,2.544084608598393e-4,2.5440846116279916e-4,2.5440846103116753e-4,2.544084611829324e-4,2.544084611069949e-4,2.5440846102409815e-4,2.5440846098323495e-4,2.544084614876056e-4
3,101002ecs21583,"The depredation of semi-domesticated reindeer by large carnivores reflects an important human-wildlife conflict in Fennoscandia. Recent studies have revealed that brown bears (Ursus arctos) may kill substantial numbers of reindeer calves (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) in forest areas in Sweden. Several authors have suggested that predation risk is an important driver of habitat selection in wild Rangifer populations where predation is a limiting factor, but little is known about these mechanisms in semi-domesticated populations. We examined the habitat selection of female reindeer in relation to spatial and temporal variations in brown bear predation risk on the reindeer calving grounds and evaluated the simultaneous responses of brown bears and reindeer to landscape characteristics. We used GPS data from 110 reindeer years (97 individuals) and 29 brown bear years (19 individuals), from two reindeer herding districts in the forest area of northern Sweden. Our results did not indicate that reindeer alter their behavior in response to spatiotemporal variation in brown bear predation risk, on the scale of the calving range. Instead, we suggest that spatiotemporal behavioral adjustments by brown bears were the main driver of prey-predator interactions in our study system. Contrasting responses by brown bears and reindeer to clear-cuts and young forest indicate that forestry can influence species interactions and possibly yield negative consequences for the reindeer herd. Even if clear-cuts may be beneficial in terms of calf survival, logging activity will eventually cause greater abundance of young regenerating forest, reducing available reindeer habitats and increasing habitat preferred by brown bears. Domestication may have made semi-domesticated reindeer in Fennoscandia less adapted to cope with predators. Areal restrictions, limiting the opportunity for dispersion and escape, possibly make the calves more susceptible to predation. Also, a generally higher population density in semi-domesticated herds compared to wild populations can make dispersion a less efficient strategy and the reindeer calves easier prey. Overall, the lack of ability of the reindeer females to reduce brown bear encounter risk on the scale of the calving range is probably an important reason for the high brown bear predation rates on reindeer calves documented in our study areas.",2.6619416490238686e-4,2.6619416475086224e-4,0.9962732816929357,2.6619416475463667e-4,2.6619416480692677e-4,2.6619416466692065e-4,2.6619416473788846e-4,2.661941646411412e-4,2.661941649116196e-4,2.661941648734583e-4,2.661941647904204e-4,2.6619416464321186e-4,2.661941646887011e-4,2.6619416503189573e-4,2.661941648641491e-4
3,101002jwmg1018,"In southern California, wildfire and urbanization influence landscape condition and features. We explored the synergistic effects of these disturbances on puma (Puma concolor) movement and habitat preference in southern California, USA using a telemetry dataset of >40 individuals from 2001 to 2011. We examined post-fire movement of tracked pumas to consider the relationship between habitat use and availability as animals used the landscape. We also explored puma response to burned areas to examine the influence of vegetation cover, time since fire, fire frequency, and the synergistic effects of urbanization on puma landscape use. We compare our results to those of others by using a complementary approach to evaluate how habitat relationships change with additional puma data and with consideration of the fire history of the landscape. Our analyses suggest that after fires, pumas use burned habitats opportunistically, responding to post-fire changes in prey density. Additionally, time since fire and fire frequency were useful predictors of puma presence at the individual- and population-level. Our puma habitat models showed a strong relationship between puma habitat use, vegetation, and human developments. Our analysis suggests that fire is an important landscape element to consider when evaluating puma habitat; pumas opportunistically used recently burned areas in the first few years after fire. We identified that pumas avoided grassland vegetation types and areas of sparse cover, suggesting that increasing fire frequency could affect puma habitat suitability and connectivity in the future. Fire frequencies in parts of southern California have already increased beyond the threshold to which the ecosystem is resilient, and if this trend continues across the region, suitable puma habitat may be lost through vegetation-type conversion to homogenous non-native annual grasslands, a habitat avoided by pumas during foraging and resting. We suggest monitoring responses to increasing fire frequency to assess how pumas and other carnivores will be affected by large-scale changes that may pose a threat to landscape integrity and persistence of puma populations in southern California.

3,101002wsb182,"Elk (Cervus elaphus) are increasing in fragmented landscapes that result from exurban human development throughout western North America, which increases human-wildlife conflicts and poses a challenge to wildlife managers. Elk hunting must often be intensively managed to reduce population growth rate, crop depredation, and habituation to humans. However, little was known about the indirect effect hunting has on anti-predator behavior, movement, resource selection, and human-elk conflicts. We outfitted elk with global positioning system (GPS) collars in the wildland-urban interface (WUI) of Missoula, Montana, USA, 2007-2009, to test the indirect effects of hunting on elk. We used data from 9GPS-collared adult female elk during 3 hunting seasons with increasing hunting pressure (2007-2009) to test relationships between movement rates measured by first passage time (FPT) and resource selection. Elk movement rates were lower approximately 750 m from houses and trails, resulting in resource selection for areas approximately 1,200 m from houses and trails; this suggested that habituation to humans contributed to human-wildlife conflict. Movement rates increased with increasing hunting pressure, and were lower in general versus focal hunting seasons and with archery versus rifle hunting. Thus, intensive hunting seasons in the WUI increased elk movement rates and exposure to hunter predation risk, as predicted. These results support the hypothesis that elk modify their behavior in relation to temporal and spatial variation in human predation risk. In the intensively managed WUI, our results demonstrate that even small increases in the area hunted and increases in intensity can indirectly change resource selection and movement rates of elk, potentially reversing recent trends of increasing habituation in WUI elk populations.

Animal-borne telemetry has revolutionized our ability to study animal movement, species physiology, demography and social structures, changing environments and the threats that animals are experiencing. While there will always be a need for basic ecological research and discovery, the current conservation crisis demands we look more pragmatically at the data required to make informed management decisions.
2. Here, we define a framework that distinguishes how research using animal telemetry devices can influence conservation. We then discuss two critical questions which aim to directly connect telemetry-derived data to applied conservation decision-making: (i) Would my choice of action change if I had more data? (ii) Is the expected gain worth the money and time required to collect more data?
3. Policy implications.

However, ecology is not the only discipline interested in movement: a number of information sciences are specialising in analysis and visualisation of movement data. The recent explosion in availability and complexity of movement data has resulted in a call in ecology for new appropriate methods that would be able to take full advantage of the increasingly complex and growing data volume. One way in which this could be done is to form interdisciplinary collaborations between ecologists and experts from information sciences that analyse movement.

4,101890ES11001661,"Human activities affect Earth's life support systems so profoundly as to threaten many of the ecological services that are essential to society. To address this challenge, a new science agenda is needed that integrates people with the rest of nature to help chart a more sustainable trajectory for the relationship between society and the biosphere. This paper describes Earth Stewardship, an initiative of the Ecological Society of America to provide the scientific basis for actively shaping trajectories of social-ecological change to enhance ecosystem resilience and human well-being. Principles for moving toward these goals include simultaneous attention to multiple scales and issues; consideration of both ecological and socioeconomic consequences; alignment of incentives with stewardship behavior; strengthening peoples' connections to valued places; and using demographic transitions as new opportunities for stewardship. Past experience provides guidelines for fostering Earth Stewardship. Early attention to sustainable pathways before problems emerge generally provides more cost-effective solutions than attempting to remediate entrenched problems. Defining sustainable pathways by assessing tradeoffs among alternative options requires careful attention to fine-scale processes, interactions, and feedbacks and to larger-scale controls and constraints. Many opportunities occur locally, through development of practices that match the properties of resources with the needs of their users. Substantial challenges remain at larger scales, including maintaining the diversity, productive capacity, and resilience of nature, which are essential for long-term human welfare. The knowledge needed to inform stewardship requires an interdisciplinary science that draws on the observations, skills, and creativity of a wide range of natural and social scientists, practitioners, and civil society.

To address this knowledge gap for a range-restricted endangered bird, we estimated home range size, daily movement patterns and habitat use of a granivorous subspecies in northeast Australia, the black-throated finch (Poephila cincta cincta; BTF) using radio-tracking and re-sighting of colour banded birds. Little is known about basic aspects of its ecology including movement patterns and home range sizes. From 2011 - 2014 we colour-banded 102 BTF and radio-tracked 15 birds.

More than 50% of the re-sightings occurred within 200 m of the banding site (n = 51 out of 93 events) and within 100 days of capture. Mean home-range estimates with kernel (50%, 95% probability) and Minimum Convex Polygons were 10.59 ha, 50.79 ha and 46.27 ha, respectively. Home range size differed between two capture sites but no seasonal differences were observed. BTF home ranges overlapped four habitat types among eight available.

BTF moved further than expected on the basis of current knowledge, with three individuals being resighted over 15 km from the banding location. However, BTF maintain small home ranges over short time-frames. Occasional long-distance movements may be related to resource bottleneck periods. Daily movement patterns differed between sites, which is likely linked to the fact that the sites differ in the spatial distribution of resources.

5,nodoi1651636958,"The northern common eider (Somateria mollissima borealis) has become a source of concern because of recent declines and possible overharvest. Birds that breed in the Canadian mid-Arctic winter in both Greenland and Canada, but the wintering grounds of birds that breed farther south are unknown. Our objectives were thus to identify the molting and wintering areas of birds breeding in Ungava Bay and to compare their home-range sizes during the pre-molt, molt, post-molt, and winter periods. Using satellite telemetry, we determined that common eiders breeding in the lower Arctic winter in Greenland (67%) and Canada (33%). These proportions are consistent with the split established for common eiders that breed farther north. Females spent their pre-molt period close to their breeding islands and had the smallest home ranges during the molt period. Winter home ranges were larger in Canada than in Greenland, probably because they contained more ice. Once settled, birds wintered in a relatively small area and did not undertake long movements. Distance between molt and winter sites ranged between 1054 and 2173 km. Duration of migration to or from wintering areas varied among individuals from rapid movement in a few days to slow progress over a month. Fall migration occurred in late October or early November, and spring migration, in early to mid-May. This study highlights the importance of Ungava Bay for northern common eiders and the need for international collaboration to ensure sustainable use of the resource.",7.33279439816219e-4,7.332794399941797e-4,7.332794405583875e-4,7.33279437598528e-4,0.9897340878627718,7.33279437502469e-4,7.33279439270526e-4,7.3327943765578e-4,7.332794388653526e-4,7.332794369685812e-4,7.33279438493229e-4,7.332794374704421e-4,7.332794369861645e-4,7.332794392068719e-4,7.332794368414008e-4

Knowledge about migration, movements and identification of stocks of this important fishery resource is scarce. Thus, we aim to study movement patterns and to identify the presence of different fish stocks in the southwestern region of the Atlantic Ocean, using cumulative otolith shape morphometric and microchemical analyses of sagittae otoliths. Specimens (n = 99) were obtained in four coastal areas: Paranagua Bay in Brazil, Saniborombon Bay, Mar Chiquita Coastal Lagoon, and San Blas Bay in Argentina. Otolith shape indices (circularity, rectangularity, aspect ratio, percentage occupied by sulcus, ellipticity and form factor) were used for stock identification analysis; and otolith microchemistry using LA-ICP-MS (Sr/Ca and Ba/Ca ratios chronological variation) was used for both the analysis of movement behaviors and the identification of fish stocks (otolith edge ratios). Morphometrical indices did not reveal a clear separation among areas. San Blas bay individuals presented otoliths tending to be longer than wider, with a more elliptic shape than the otoliths from other studied areas; also, this area did not share individuals with the most northern one, Paranagua Bay in Brazil. The analysis of microchemical lifetime profiles revealed three types of behavior pattern: Type I: most frequent use of estuarine environments; Type II: a fluctuating behavior between estuarine and sea/high salinity waters; Type III: most frequent use of sea/high salinity habitats. Otolith edge analysis did not reveal differences among Sr/Ca and Ba/Ca ratios for the different areas. Thus, it cannot be assured that there is more than one stock in the studied region. Mugil Um revealed different environmental migratory behaviors in the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean showing a facultative use of estuarine waters; hence, the species appears to be mostly coastal with the use of low estuaries, as seen also by the Sr/Ca otolith cores ratios; differing from the general mugilid behavior previoulsy described.",2.4362213064115285e-4,2.436221312421193e-4,2.4362213048734506e-4,2.4362213099150067e-4,2.436221305527711e-4,0.9965892901688718,2.436221308032621e-4,2.4362213051765428e-4,2.4362213055327604e-4,2.4362213100783198e-4,2.4362213058453785e-4,2.4362213166602908e-4,2.4362213103361447e-4,2.4362213056057958e-4,2.436221304865599e-4
6,101016jecss201702018,"The Flathead grey mullet, Mugil cephalus is the most globally-distributed Mugilidae species and its migrations and movement patterns have been studied globally but not in-depth in the Mediterranean region. Thus, the present study aimed: (1) to identify migratory patterns throughout the life-history of the Mugil cephalus in different Spanish Mediterranean wetlands, and (2) to study the presence of potential fish stocks of the species in the region, by means of otolith microchemistry. Specimens (n = 43) were obtained in three wetlands: Parque Natural Delta del Ebro (DE), a stratified estuary; Parque Natural de l'Albufera de Valencia (AV), a Mediterranean lake; and Parque Natural Salinas de Santa Pola (SP), a coastal salt marsh. Otolith microchemistry was studied using LA-ICP-MS (chronological variation of Sr:Ca and Ba:Ca ratios). The analysis of lifetime profiles revealed four behavioral patterns: Type I: most frequent use of estuarine environments (estuarine resident); Type II: freshwater behaviour during, early life history, moving though estuarine to marine waters at the end of their profile (freshwater migrant); Type III: estuarine water use in early life stages moving then towards sea waters (estuarine migrant); and Type IV: sea/high salinity water habitat use during their entire lifetime (seawater resident). A Canonical Discriminant Analysis, using Sr:Ca and Ba:Ca ratios from core and edge as variables, assigned individuals to the detected patterns with high accuracy (Type I > 95%; Type Il and Type III > 83%; and Type IV > 88%). Moreover, two potential fish stocks were identified by the analysis of Sr:Ca otoliths-edge ratios: one in the Valencian Gulf, DE-AV areas presented similar ratios, and the other in the southern location, SP (higher Sr:Ca values). Mugil cephaius presented diverse life patterns on the Valencian Community Mediterranean coast. Different strategies could be identified by the used methodology: some particular to an area (Type IV-SP); others shared among areas, changing environments in different stages of their life. The presence of different fish stocks could be influenced by a mesoscale current phenomenon observed in the region associated with the Balearic front. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

6,101890150497,"Spawning site selection and reproductive timing affect stock productivity and structure in marine fishes but are poorly understood. Traditionally, stock assessments measure reproductive potential as spawning stock biomass or egg production and do not include other aspects of reproductive behavior. Red drum make an excellent case study to assess these other aspects, as (1) they are highly fecund, pelagic spawners, like most exploited marine fishes; (2) their life cycle is delineated between nursery (estuarine) and adult (coastal and offshore) habitat; and (3) they are managed at these two spatial scales. This study was conducted from August 2012 to December 2013 and integrates data from multiple methods and spatial scales. Aerial surveys were used for large-scale monitoring of aggregations off two known estuarine nursery areas, Tampa Bay and Charlotte Harbor, Florida, USA. Capture-based sampling in Tampa Bay coastal (n = 2581) and estuarine waters (n = 158) was used to assess reproductive state and to confirm coastal spawning. To assess spatial dynamics, we acoustically tagged two population components in the Tampa Bay system, subadults from the estuary (n = 20) and adults from the coastal spawning site (n = 60). Behavioral plasticity was seen in subadult recruitment to coastal habitat, with some subadults maturing and recruiting before or during the spawning season and others (14 of 20 acoustically tagged fish) recruiting at the end of the 2012 spawning season. Both adults and recruited subadults (n = 29) were consequently detected in the Charlotte Harbor array, 132 km to the south. Spawning-site fidelity to the Tampa Bay spawning site occurred at both the population and individual scales. Aggregations consistently occurred in Tampa Bay coastal waters during the spawning season, and approximately two-thirds of tagged adults returned in the 2013 spawning season. A similar proportion of subadults returned to the Tampa Bay spawning site, exhibiting natal homing. However, these first-time spawners arrived later than repeat spawners and were detected over shorter time periods. This study, and others like it, demonstrates how integrating data from individuals tracked over space and time with more traditional population-based sampling is changing our understanding of ecological processes that affect marine fish productivity and our ability to manage for sustainablity.",2.774402535077122e-4,2.774402534027492e-4,2.774402531495838e-4,2.7744025342034954e-4,2.774402537918948e-4,0.9961158364523951,2.774402532737268e-4,2.7744025356857976e-4,2.774402535434866e-4,2.774402532353723e-4,2.7744025344319503e-4,2.774402535334564e-4,2.7744025324089657e-4,2.774402530159012e-4,2.774402534779084e-4
6,101371journalpone0101809,"Reproductive behavior affects spatial population structure and our ability to manage for sustainability in marine and diadromous fishes. In this study, we used fishery independent capture-based sampling to evaluate where Common Snook occurred in Tampa Bay and if it changed with spawning season, and passive acoustic telemetry to assess fine scale behavior at an inlet spawning site (2007-2009). Snook concentrated in three areas during the spawning season only one of which fell within the expected spawning habitat. Although in lower numbers, they remained in these areas throughout the winter months. Acoustically-tagged snook (n = 31) showed two seasonal patterns at the spawning site: Most fish occurred during the spawning season but several fish displayed more extended residency, supporting the capture-based findings that Common Snook exhibit facultative catadromy. Spawning site selection for iteroparous, multiple-batch spawning fishes occurs at the lifetime, annual, or intra-annual temporal scales. In this study we show colonization of a new spawning site, indicating that lifetime spawning site fidelity of Common Snook is not fixed at this fine spatial scale. However, individuals did exhibit annual and intra-seasonal spawning site fidelity to this new site over the three years studied. The number of fish at the spawning site increased in June and July (peak spawning months) and on new and full lunar phases indicating within population variability in spawning and movement patterns. Intra-seasonal patterns of detection also differed significantly with sex. Common Snook exhibited divergent migration tactics and habitat use at the annual and estuarine scales, with contingents using different overwintering habitat. Migration tactics also varied at the spawning site at the intra-seasonal scale and with sex. These results have important implications for understanding how reproductive behavior affects spatio-temporal patterns of fish abundance and their resilience to disturbance events and fishing pressure.",2.6619416526065193e-4,2.6619416470875784e-4,2.661941654814673e-4,2.661941647336578e-4,2.661941653689704e-4,0.9962732816902911,2.661941651624075e-4,2.6619416464412535e-4,2.661941648574282e-4,2.6619416454160867e-4,2.661941650923065e-4,2.6619416495276063e-4,2.661941646382374e-4,2.6619416550990237e-4,2.6619416475671834e-4
6,101371journalpone0088470,"Resolving the geographic extent and timing of coastal shark migrations, as well as their environmental cues, is essential for refining shark management strategies in anticipation of increasing anthropogenic stressors to coastal ecosystems. We employed a regional-scale passive acoustic telemetry array encompassing 300 km of the east Florida coast to assess what factors influence site fidelity of juvenile lemon sharks (Negaprion brevirostris) to an exposed coastal nursery at Cape Canaveral, and to document the timing and rate of their seasonal migrations. Movements of 54 juvenile lemon sharks were monitored for three years with individuals tracked for up to 751 days. While most sharks demonstrated site fidelity to the Cape Canaveral region December through February under typical winter water temperatures, historically extreme declines in ocean temperature were accompanied by rapid and often temporary, southward displacements of up to 190 km along the Florida east coast. From late February through April each year, most sharks initiated a northward migration at speeds of up to 64 km day(-1) with several individuals then detected in compatible estuarine telemetry arrays in Georgia and South Carolina up to 472 km from release locations. Nineteen sharks returned for a second or even third consecutive winter, thus demonstrating strong seasonal philopatry to the Cape Canaveral region. The long distance movements and habitat associations of immature lemon sharks along the US southeast coast contrast sharply with the natal site fidelity observed in this species at other sites in the western Atlantic Ocean. These findings validate the existing multi-state management strategies now in place. Results also affirm the value of collaborative passive arrays for resolving seasonal movements and habitat preferences of migratory coastal shark species not easily studied with other tagging techniques.",2.313606832253391e-4,2.3136068329321084e-4,2.3136068323399044e-4,2.3136068326667773e-4,2.3136068323524386e-4,0.996760950437199,2.3136068305151843e-4,2.3136068278230108e-4,2.3136068294057368e-4,2.3136068291242215e-4,2.3136068290751486e-4,2.3136068293381563e-4,2.3136068284580088e-4,2.3136068305381233e-4,2.3136068311874363e-4
7,101002ecs22301,"Due to rapidly changing global environmental conditions, many animals are now experiencing concurrent changes in both resource availability and the foraging cues associated with finding those resources. By employing flexible, plastic foraging strategies that use different types of environmental foraging cues, animals could adapt to these novel future environments. To evaluate the extent to which such flexibility and plasticity exist, we analyzed a large dataset of a Glade (Sulidae; the boobies) of widespread aerial tropical predators that feed in highly variable marine habitats. These surface foragers are typical of many ocean predators that face dynamic and patchy foraging environments and use a combination of static and ephemeral oceanographic features to locate prey. We compared foraging habitats and behaviors of four species at seven colonies in the eastern and central Pacific Ocean that varied greatly in depth, topography, and primary productivity. Foraging behaviors, recorded by GPS-tracking tags, were compared to remotely sensed environmental features, to characterize habitat-behavior interactions. K-means clustering grouped environmental characteristics into five habitat clusters across the seven sites. We found that boobies relied on a combination of static and ephemeral cues, especially depth, chlorophyll-a concentrations, and sea surface height (ocean surface topography). Notably, foraging behaviors were strongly predicted by local oceanographic habitats across species and sites, suggesting a high degree of behavioral plasticity in use of different foraging cues. Flexibility allows these top predators to adapt to, and exploit, static and ephemeral oceanic features. Plasticity may well facilitate these species, and other similarly dynamic foragers, to cope with increasingly changing environmental conditions.",3.0304626261201087e-4,3.0304626249043337e-4,3.0304626246755654e-4,3.0304626272152017e-4,3.030462623728167e-4,3.0304626306527536e-4,0.9957573523259889,3.0304626241721584e-4,3.0304626263259624e-4,3.030462622810935e-4,3.030462623396763e-4,3.030462624732808e-4,3.030462619334201e-4,3.030462616266216e-4,3.030462625776253e-4
7,103354meps12376,"Foraging with tuna is a well-documented seabird strategy, referred to as facilitated foraging. However, despite this behaviour being considered almost obligatory in nutrient-poor tropical waters, little data exist on its relative importance to individual colonies. Therefore, to examine facilitated foraging under different patterns of nutrient availability, we tracked wedgetailed shearwaters Ardenna pacifica from 2 colonies, one tropical and one subtropical, situated in waters of contrasting productivity. Shearwater foraging behaviour was assessed relative to oceanographic covariates and predicted distributions for multiple tropical tuna species and age-classes, simulated by an existing ecosystem model (SEAPODYM). Shearwaters from both colonies undertook long trips to deep, pelagic waters close to seamounts and foraged most often at fronts and eddies. Micronektonic and adult tuna age classes were highly correlated in space. Predation between these tuna age classes represents a likely source of facilitated foraging opportunities for shearwaters. At broad spatio-temporal scales, shearwaters consistently foraged in areas with higher predicted adult skipjack and micronektonic tuna densities and avoided adult bigeye tuna. At finer spatio-temporal scales, dynamic ocean features aggregated tuna of all sizes. Enhanced tuna density at these locations increased the likelihood of shearwater foraging activity. Long trips in the tropics targeted oligotrophic waters with higher tuna densities. Long trips in the subtropics targeted enhanced productivity, but in some years shifted to target the same oligotrophic, tunadense waters used by tropical conspecifics. We conclude that facilitated foraging with tuna is consistently important to the tropical breeding population and becomes increasingly important to the subtropical population in years of low marine productivity.",2.3733314532909156e-4,2.373331453159497e-4,2.3733314504591926e-4,2.373331450320549e-4,2.3733314534456307e-4,2.373331454312278e-4,0.9966773359662464,2.3733314536164633e-4,2.373331451177119e-4,2.3733314533622824e-4,2.3733314532253046e-4,2.373331452292331e-4,2.3733314550149865e-4,2.3733314500017463e-4,2.3733314538567458e-4
7,103354meps11875,"Many marine predators migrate between breeding and non-breeding areas to target resources that are seasonal but spatio-temporally predictable, and so are vulnerable to climate-induced changes in prey phenology and abundance. In the Southern Ocean, small petrels are major consumers, but perturbations in the ecosystem through ocean warming are altering food-web structure and have been linked to poleward shifts in the distribution of their cold-water zooplankton prey. In this study, we focused on 2 small congeneric petrels: the broad-billed prion Pachyptila vittata and the Antarctic prion P. desolata. Both are planktivorous, but the broad-billed prion specialises in feeding on large copepods. We investigated historical trends in non-breeding distribution by analysing feather stable isotope ratios from a time-series dating back to 1926, and examined contemporary non-breeding distributions of broad-billed prions tracked using miniaturised geolocation-immersion loggers. After controlling temporally for the Suess effect, we found that the delta C-13 signatures of Antarctic prions, but not broad-billed prions, declined during the study period. This suggests a southward shift in Antarctic prion non-breeding distribution over the last century. Both species exhibited significant declines in delta N-15 during the same period, indicative of long-term decreases in marine productivity in their moulting areas, or changes in the trophic structure of prey communities. Tracked broad-billed prions migrated ca. 1000 km to an area east of the breeding colony where the Louisville seamount chain bisects the subtropical front. Topographically driven upwellings are stable and predictable features and may be crucial in aggregating plankton. Targeting seamounts could therefore mitigate the impact of climate-induced prey shifts by providing refugia for the broad-billed prion.",2.933759844922575e-4,2.9337598425879915e-4,2.93375984531228e-4,2.933759841997044e-4,2.933759845563221e-4,2.933759846952731e-4,0.9958927362188262,2.933759841556866e-4,2.9337598429077585e-4,2.9337598404504604e-4,2.9337598468501627e-4,2.9337598422919236e-4,2.933759842243162e-4,2.933759842562187e-4,2.9337598455381767e-4
7,101016jjembe201411005,"Flexible foraging behaviour allows marine predators to exploit shifting prey diversity and adjust to spatiotemporal changes in the distribution of prey. In diving marine predators, the number of dives within a dive bout, distances between dives in a bout and distances between bouts have been related to prey patch size, density of prey patches and prey encounter rates, respectively. In addition, the predictability of prey encounters can be examined by studying individuals' foraging site fidelity. Based on this, we examined in chick-rearing Masked boobies (Sula dactylatra) from Phillip Island (South-west Pacific), Australia, using GPS and depth-acceleration data logger, how these parameters changed over time (two early breeding phases and one late phase over two years) and according to foraging locations and environmental conditions. Results revealed that birds foraged in two distinct areas: over a nearby shallow shelf (""local area"") and over distant deeper waters (""distant area""). Birds searched for prey in the distant area only during the two latest study periods, indicating less favourable foraging conditions within the local area during this time, although persistent higher chlorophyll-a concentrations in the local area were indicative of an upwelling. Our data suggest that birds experienced a trade-off between local and distant trips: although the strong foraging site fidelity within the local area suggests that prey encounters were predictable, smaller dive bouts indicated smaller prey patches, i.e. less prey nearby the colony during the two latest study periods. As a consequence, adults undertook distant trips to forage in larger prey patches, as inferred from larger dive bouts, but distances between these dive bouts were more variable and birds showed no foraging site fidelity, indicating less predictable prey encounters. Local trips presumably allow a high feeding frequency of the chick, while distant trips allow adults to replenish their own body reserves. Observed changes in foraging conditions, although the underlying causes were not determined, appear to be within the ecophysiological limitations of Masked boobies. However, further studies are required to determine the degree of this limitation, especially as changes in the spatio-temporal availability of prey can be expected to increase with global warming and changing oceanic processes.

7,101016jpocean201004012,"We studied the foraging behavior and marine habitats used by Laysan (Phoebastria immutabilis) and Black-footed (Phoebastria nigripes) Albatrosses, during four consecutive breeding seasons to investigate whether these marine predators changed habitat preferences, foraging distributions, or both, in accordance with natural interannual variability in the marine environment. We used satellite telemetry to track a total of 37 Laysan and 36 Black-footed Albatrosses during the incubation periods of 2002-2006 at Tern Island, Northwest Hawaiian Islands. First passage time analysis was used to determine search effort of individual albatrosses along their respective tracks, and this metric was then related to oceanographic habitat variables using linear mixed-effects regression. The majority of individuals traveled to pelagic waters of the North Pacific, with Laysan Albatrosses demonstrating a more northwesterly distribution from the breeding colony. Laysan Albatrosses traveled farther, for longer periods, and demonstrated greater interannual variability in trip characteristics than Black-footed Albatrosses. For Laysan Albatrosses, maximum trip distance was negatively correlated with body mass change during foraging and overall breeding success. There was considerable interspecific segregation of foraging habitats, and low overlap of foraging distributions between years. For all years, and both species, sea surface temperature was consistently the most important environmental variable predicting search effort of albatrosses, suggesting that both species use similar environmental cues when searching for prey. In the context of climate variability, our results suggest that Hawaiian albatrosses demonstrate flexibility in foraging strategies and track preferred marine habitats. However, adjusting foraging behavior to climatic variability may have energetic, and subsequent reproductive consequences. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

8,101093icbicv017,"Synopsis Billfishes are considered among the fastest swimmers in the oceans. Despite early estimates of extremely high speeds, more recent work showed that these predators (e.g., blue marlin) spend most of their time swimming slowly, rarely exceeding 2 m s(-1). Predator-prey interactions provide a context within which one may expect maximal speeds both by predators and prey. Beyond speed, however, an important component determining the outcome of predator-prey encounters is unsteady swimming (i.e., turning and accelerating). Although large predators are faster than their small prey, the latter show higher performance in unsteady swimming. To contrast the evading behaviors of their highly maneuverable prey, sailfish and other large aquatic predators possess morphological adaptations, such as elongated bills, which can be moved more rapidly than the whole body itself, facilitating capture of the prey. Therefore, it is an open question whether such supposedly very fast swimmers do use high-speed bursts when feeding on evasive prey, in addition to using their bill for slashing prey. Here, we measured the swimming behavior of sailfish by using high-frequency accelerometry and high-speed video observations during predator-prey interactions. These measurements allowed analyses of tail beat frequencies to estimate swimming speeds. Our results suggest that sailfish burst at speeds of about 7 m s(-1) and do not exceed swimming speeds of 10 m s(-1) during predator-prey interactions. These speeds are much lower than previous estimates. In addition, the oscillations of the bill during swimming with, and without, extension of the dorsal fin (i.e., the sail) were measured. We suggest that extension of the dorsal fin may allow sailfish to improve the control of the bill and minimize its yaw, hence preventing disturbance of the prey. Therefore, sailfish, like other large predators, may rely mainly on accuracy of movement and the use of the extensions of their bodies, rather than resorting to top speeds when hunting evasive prey.",3.0106154026886056e-4,3.010615400247151e-4,3.01061539948248e-4,3.010615400270476e-4,3.0106153990125536e-4,3.0106154041239293e-4,3.01061540040466e-4,0.9957851384380957,3.0106154022086266e-4,3.0106154015808247e-4,3.0106154058970254e-4,3.0106153991453136e-4,3.0106154021905215e-4,3.0106154019431044e-4,3.010615399849052e-4
8,101093icbicv016,"Synopsis One of the most-studied unsteady locomotor behaviors exhibited by fishes is the c-start escape response. Although the kinematics of these responses have been studied extensively and two well-defined kinematic stages have been documented, only a few studies have focused on hydrodynamic patterns generated by fishes executing escape behaviors. Previous work has shown that escape responses by bluegill sunfish generate three distinct vortex rings, each with central orthogonal jet flows, and here we extend this conclusion to two other species: stickleback and mosquitofish. Jet #1 is formed by the tail during Stage 1, and moves in the same direction as Stage-2 movement of the fish, thereby reducing final escape-velocity but also rotating the fish. Jet #2, in contrast, moves approximately opposite to the final direction of the fish's motion and contains the bulk of the total fluid-momentum powering the escape response. Jet #3 forms during Stage 2 in the mid-body region and moves in a direction approximately perpendicular to jets 1 and 2, across the direction of movement of the body. In this study, we used a mechanical controller to impulsively move passively flexible plastic panels of three different stiffnesses in heave, pitch, and heave_pitch motions to study the effects of stiffness on unsteady hydrodynamics of escape. We were able to produce kinematics very similar to those of fish c-starts and also to reproduce the 3-jet hydrodynamic pattern of the c-start using a panel of medium flexural stiffness and the combined heave_pitch motion. This medium-stiffness panel matched the measured stiffness of the near-tail region of fish bodies. This motion also produced positive power when the panel straightened during stage 2 of the escape response. More flexible and stiffer panels resulted in non-biological kinematics and patterns of flow for all motions. The use of simple flexible models with a mechanical controller and program of fish-like motion is a promising approach for studying unsteady behaviors of fish which can be difficult to manipulate experimentally in live animals.",2.896785007697283e-4,2.896785003938671e-4,2.8967850032615196e-4,2.8967850022857387e-4,2.89678500462881e-4,2.8967850082226346e-4,2.896785004533465e-4,0.9959445009931747,2.8967850046854115e-4,2.896785005109302e-4,2.896785004993135e-4,2.8967850031238996e-4,2.8967850070089614e-4,2.8967850043853027e-4,2.896785004379538e-4
8,101016jzool201404004,"The maneuverability demonstrated by the weakly electric ghost knifefish (Apteronotus albifrons) is a result of its highly flexible ribbon-like anal fin, which extends nearly three-quarters the length of its body and is composed of approximately 150 individual fin rays. To understand how movement of the anal fin controls locomotion we examined kinematics of the whole fin, as well as selected individual fin rays, during four locomotor behaviors executed by free-swimming ghost knifefish: forward swimming, backward swimming, heave (vertical) motion, and hovering. We used high-speed video (1000 fps) to examine the motion of the entire anal fin and we measured the three-dimensional curvature of four adjacent fin rays in the middle of the fin during each behavior to determine how individual fin rays bend along their length during swimming. Canonical discriminant analysis separated all four behaviors oil anal fin kinematic variables and showed that forward and backward swimming behaviors contrasted the most: forward behaviors exhibited a large anterior wavelength and posterior amplitude while during backward locomotion the anal fin exhibited both a large posterior wavelength and anterior amplitude. Heave and hover behaviors were defined by similar kinematic variables; however, for each variable, the mean values for heave motions were generally greater than for hovering. Individual fin rays in the middle of the anal fin curved substantially along their length during swimming, and the magnitude of this curvature was nearly twice the previously measured maximum curvature for ray-finned fish fin rays during locomotion. Fin rays were often curved into the direction of motion, indicating active control of fin ray curvature, and not just passive bending in response to fluid loading. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH.

8,101016jzool201211002,"Benthic animals live at the juncture of fluid and solid environments, an interface that shapes many aspects of their behavior, including their means of locomotion. Aquatic walking and similar substrate-dependent forms of underwater propulsion have evolved multiple times in benthic invertebrate and vertebrate taxa, including batoid elasmobranchs. Skates (Rajidae) use the pelvic fins to punt across the substrate, keeping the pectoral fin disc still. Other batoids combine pelvic fin motions with pectoral fin undulation in augmented punting, but the coordination of these two modes has not been described. In this study of an augmented punter, the freshwater stingray Potamotrygon orbignyi, we demonstrate the synchrony of pelvic and pectoral fin cycles. The punt begins as the pelvic fins, held in an anterior position, are planted into the substrate and used to push the body forward. Meanwhile, a wave of pectoral fin undulation begins, increasing to maximum height just before the cycle's halfway point, when the pelvic fins reach their furthest posterior extension. The pectoral fin wave subsides as the pelvic fins return to their starting position for subsequent punts. Despite definitive links between pectoral and pelvic fin activity, we find no significant relationship between pectoral fin kinematics (frequency, wave height, and wave speed) and punt performance. However, slip calculations indicate that pectoral undulation can produce thrust and augment punting. Pelvic fin kinematics (frequency and duty factor) have significant effects, suggesting that while both sets of fins contribute to thrust generation, the pelvic fins likely determine punt performance.

8,101242jeb062711,"We designed a robotic fish caudal fin with six individually moveable fin rays based on the tail of the bluegill sunfish, Lepomis macrochirus. Previous fish robotic tail designs have loosely resembled the caudal fin of fishes, but have not incorporated key biomechanical components such as fin rays that can be controlled to generate complex tail conformations and motion programs similar to those seen in the locomotor repertoire of live fishes. We used this robotic caudal fin to test for the effects of fin ray stiffness, frequency and motion program on the generation of thrust and lift forces. Five different sets of fin rays were constructed to be from 150 to 2000 times the stiffness of biological fin rays, appropriately scaled for the robotic caudal fin, which had linear dimensions approximately four times larger than those of adult bluegill sunfish. Five caudal fin motion programs were identified as kinematic features of swimming behaviors in live bluegill sunfish, and were used to program the kinematic repertoire: flat movement of the entire fin, cupping of the fin, W-shaped fin motion, fin undulation and rolling movements. The robotic fin was flapped at frequencies ranging from 0.5 to 2.4 Hz. All fin motions produced force in the thrust direction, and the cupping motion produced the most thrust in almost all cases. Only the undulatory motion produced lift force of similar magnitude to the thrust force. More compliant fin rays produced lower peak magnitude forces than the stiffer fin rays at the same frequency. Thrust and lift forces increased with increasing flapping frequency; thrust was maximized by the 500x stiffness fin rays and lift was maximized by the 1000x stiffness fin rays.",2.843037832549618e-4,2.843037835934171e-4,2.8430378322848176e-4,2.843037836065436e-4,2.843037834041863e-4,2.8430378361014337e-4,2.84303783176499e-4,0.9960197470321629,2.8430378361402807e-4,2.843037833926077e-4,2.843037832066668e-4,2.843037832143559e-4,2.8430378349625335e-4,2.8430378355545985e-4,2.8430378348344464e-4
9,101071MF18125,"The exploitation of riverine systems for renewable energy has resulted in large numbers of small-scale hydropower schemes on low-head weirs. Although considered a clean and 'green' energy source in terms of emissions, hydropower can affect upstream migrating species by diverting flow away from viable routes over the impoundment and attract fish towards the turbine outfall. In an attempt to reduce this negative effect, hydropower outfalls with co-located fish-passage entrances are recommended, utilising turbine flows to attract fish towards the fish pass. The present study used acoustic telemetry to understand the performance of a co-located Larinier fish pass at a low-head hydropower scheme at a weir on the tidal Yorkshire Esk, England. The majority of the sea trout (anadromous Salmo trutta L.) individuals that approached the impediment were attracted to the hydropower and the co-located fish pass. Fish ascended through the pass under a wide range of river flows, tide heights, downstream river levels and hydropower flows, and there was no evidence that the hydropower operation affected fish-pass ascent. The information presented is urgently required to inform management decisions on the operation of hydropower schemes during the migratory period of salmonid fish, and help determine best-practice designs and operation at these facilities.",3.2443431068486213e-4,3.244343103745182e-4,3.244343110029811e-4,3.244343108482026e-4,3.24434311367248e-4,3.244343109540423e-4,3.244343100943286e-4,3.24434310472622e-4,0.9954579196523101,3.244343100807948e-4,3.2443431002714026e-4,3.2443431070236744e-4,3.2443431034495185e-4,3.2443431012730753e-4,3.2443431060845315e-4
9,101578AM4032014232,"To compare the effect of naval sonar up-sweeps and down-sweeps on the behavior of harbor porpoises, a harbor porpoise in a large pool was exposed to simulated low-and mid-frequency active sonar signals (series of 1-s duration frequency-modulated sweeps). Three sweep pairs were tested: (1) a 1 to 2 kHz up-sweep was compared with a 2 to 1 kHz down-sweep (both without harmonics) at a mean received sound pressure level (mean received SPL) of 114 dB re 1 mu Pa; (2) a 1 to 2 kHz up-sweep was compared with a 2 to 1 kHz down-sweep (both with harmonics; mean received SPL: 123 dB re 1 mu Pa); and (3) a 6 to 7 kHz up-sweep was compared with a 7 to 6 kHz down-sweep (both without harmonics; mean SPL: 107 dB re 1 mu Pa). For each sweep pair, the level was chosen during a pretest session with the intention that the harbor porpoise would respond to the sounds by moving away from the projector and surfacing more often (i.e., he would show a change in behavior).
The study consists of three separate parts, so only a comparison within sweep pairs could be made and not between sweep pairs. For the 1 to 2 kHz sweeps with harmonics, the harbor porpoise swam further away from the sound source in response to the up-sweeps than to the down-sweeps. For the other two sweep pairs, sweep type (up-sweep or down-sweep) caused no significant difference in the harbor porpoise's response. Thus, to allow the evaluation of potential effects of sonar sounds on harbor porpoises, sonar signal measurements should include the harmonics. For simulated naval sonar sounds with fundamental frequencies in the 1 to 2 kHz range containing harmonics, using down-sweeps appears to affect harbor porpoise behavior less than using up-sweeps.",3.840682201293357e-4,3.84068220021982e-4,3.840682199155126e-4,3.840682206354879e-4,3.840682200529692e-4,3.8406822078133456e-4,3.8406822000697325e-4,3.840682206555683e-4,0.9946230449182042,3.840682199940439e-4,3.8406821965792515e-4,3.8406822048039864e-4,3.840682202556702e-4,3.8406821931327235e-4,3.840682198953273e-4
9,103354aei00105,"Salmon lice Lepeophtheirus salmonis Kroyer may affect survival and growth of anadromous salmonids through physiological stress and/or behavioural changes. Using acoustic telemetry tracking, we investigated the behaviour of 30 infected sea trout Salmo trutta throughout the summer in a fjord with very high salmon lice infection pressure. Most of the tracked sea trout adopted a movement pattern expected to suppress salmon lice infestation, as they showed a strong preference for fresh or brackish water, spending most of the time close to a river outlet or even migrating into the river. Highly infested sea trout preferred shallower depths, associated with lower salinity. The fish lost to predation stayed further away from the river outlet than nonpredated fish, and were likely subjected to a stronger infection pressure. Half of the tracked group were treated with a salmon lice prophylaxis, emamectin benzoate. The effect of treatment on infestation was monitored in a separate group held in a sea cage and found to be moderate; the mortality in this group was associated with infestation by motile lice stages. In contrast, treatment was not found to have an effect on tracked fish behaviour. It is likely that some physiological and behavioural responses to high salmon lice infection pressure may be present even after a prophylaxis treatment, in particular when the treatment is given after exposure to salmon lice infection. We conclude that increased salmon lice infection pressure associated with altered salmon farming practice may have the potential to influence the marine behaviour and growth of sea trout.",2.2679486923242621e-4,2.2679486945416274e-4,2.2679486916120145e-4,2.267948692393384e-4,2.2679486935261092e-4,2.267948689741495e-4,2.267948688501453e-4,2.2679486874308438e-4,0.9968248718337529,2.267948688448623e-4,2.2679486872014432e-4,2.2679486902283107e-4,2.267948688148644e-4,2.267948688752865e-4,2.2679486896200164e-4
9,101002rra2616,"Relatively little is known about the downstream migration of landlocked stocks of Atlantic salmon Salmo salar L. smolts, as earlier migration studies have generally focused on upstream migration. However, in watersheds with many hydroelectric plants (HEPs), multiplicative loss of downstream-migrating salmon smolts can be high, contributing to population declines or extirpations. Here we report the results from a study of wild landlocked Atlantic salmon smolts in the River Klaralven. Salmon smolts, tagged with acoustic transmitters, were released at different locations and followed as they passed 37 receivers along a 180-km-long river segment, including eight dams as well as free-flowing control stretches. We found that 16% of the smolts successfully migrated along the entire river segment. Most losses occurred during HEP passages, with 76% of the smolts being lost during these passages, which contrasts with the 8% smolt loss along unregulated control stretches. Migration speed was 83% slower along regulated stretches than along unregulated stretches. The observed lower migration speed at regulated stretches was dependent on fish size, with large fish moving slower than small fish. Discharge affected migration speed but not losses. As previously shown for anadromous populations, our study of landlocked salmon demonstrates similar negative effects of multiple passages of HEPs by downstream-migrating smolts. On the basis of this and previous migration studies, we advocate using a holistic approach in the management and conservation of migratory fish in regulated rivers, which includes safe passage for both upstream- and downstream-migrating fish.

9,101111j13652427201002459x,"P>1. The European eel population has decreased drastically during recent decades, and new EU-legislation calls for measures to change this negative trend. This decline has been attributed to a number of factors, including habitat fragmentation by structural barriers that prevent eels moving between freshwater and the sea. The success of downstream migrating adult silver eels migrating past a hydroelectric plant (HEP) in Sweden was examined by radio-telemetry, and the results were considered in a historical context by analysing catch data from the river for 1957-2006.
2. The choice of routes and passage success were quantified for three treatment groups and one control group of silver eels. The first treatment, the reservoir group (n = 50), was released into the reservoir upstream of the HEP, and these fish could proceed downstream by passing through the HEP (20 mm rack and turbines) or by entering the spill gates into the former channel, bypassing the HEP. The second treatment group (inside rack, n = 15) was released downstream of the 20-mm rack and had to pass through the turbines to continue migration to the sea. The third treatment group consisted of dead radio-tagged eels (n = 6) that were released into the turbines to study the extent of drifting by dead individuals. Finally, the control group (n = 50) was released downstream of the HEP to test for effects of confounding factors.
3. Most live individuals displayed migratory behaviour and continued to proceed downstream after release. Only 8% of the fish released in the reservoir or downstream of the HEP (control) did not migrate. The probability of reaching the next HEP, 24 km further downstream, was high for the control group (96%) and the reservoir-released individuals that passed the HEP via the spill gates and the former channel (83%). Survival was low and size-dependent for the individuals that passed the turbines (40%) and even lower for the individuals that had to pass through the rack and the turbines (26%). The overall passage success for eels released in the reservoir was 30%, including both routes.
4. Annual catch data from 1957 to 2006 showed that the number of eels in the River Atran has decreased. Despite this decrease, escapement biomass has remained unchanged, because of the fact that the mean size of eels has doubled. Passage data from 2007 show that changes in size and abundance have resulted in a reduction of relative escapement to the sea to values that are 21-24% of what they were in 1957-66. However, this low level of escapement could potentially be rectified if appropriate measures facilitating HEP passage are successfully implemented, since the potential escapement biomass in the river, owing to the large size of the eels, has changed little since the 1950s.",3.6284722882285044e-4,3.628472279771183e-4,3.6284722813015015e-4,3.628472280730338e-4,3.628472282230399e-4,3.628472286178037e-4,3.628472283710587e-4,3.6284722821846313e-4,0.994920138803264,3.628472284865934e-4,3.628472287673369e-4,3.628472284119133e-4,3.628472280301351e-4,3.6284722816560383e-4,3.6284722844090564e-4

Serum haptoglobin concentration was greater (P < 0.01) in INJ than BUL and BAN on days 1, 3, 5, and 7. Scrotal circumference (P = 0.08) and testis width (P = 0.07) on day 168 tended to be greater for BUL than INJ. Motion index (P <= 0.02) and step count (P = 0.04) was greater in BUL and INJ compared to BAN cattle during the 28 d monitoring period. No difference in standing time (P >= 0.85) or lying bouts (P = 0.35) occurred. Zinc injection resulted in sterilization but did not cause complete cessation of testicular function evidenced by testosterone concentrations more similar to BUL than BAN. This resulted in overall increased BW and G: F for INJ vs. BAN, yet the acute phase response was markedly greater directly after Zn injection. Collectively, Zn injection resulted in outcomes more similar to BUL than BAN, implying minimal efficacy of INJ as a castration method in older bulls arriving to the feedlot.",2.0458872945157302e-4,2.045887293379338e-4,2.045887294274064e-4,2.0458872940382257e-4,2.045887296801928e-4,2.045887296029003e-4,2.0458872932179636e-4,2.0458872933528248e-4,2.0458872940443826e-4,0.9971357577874602,2.0458872964223795e-4,2.0458872928582667e-4,2.0458872946609686e-4,2.0458872960461846e-4,2.0458872957563115e-4
10,101093jasskx022,"Our objective was to determine the effect of castration timing, method, and use of the analgesic meloxicam (MEL) on inflammation, behavior, performance, and carcass traits in feedlot cattle. This study was a randomized complete block design conducted over a 3-yr period. In total, 194 crossbred beef calves from a single ranch origin were randomized at birth to receive one of five treatments arranged as a 2 x 2 + 1 factorial: 1) bulls castrated within 48 h of birth (CON), 2) bulls surgically castrated on day 0 without MEL (SUR), 3) bulls surgically castrated on day 0 with MEL (SUR + MEL), 4) bulls band castrated on d 0 without MEL (BAN), and 5) bulls band castrated on day 0 with MEL (BAN + MEL). Upon feedlot arrival (day -11; average 287 +/- 2.03 d of age), animals were blocked by initial BW (224 +/- 4.5 kg) and assigned randomly to treatment pens in three consecutive years (n = 2 pens per treatment in each year). Oral MEL was administered at 1 mg/kg BW concurrent with applicable castration treatment on day 0. Data were analyzed using the MIXED and GLIMMIX procedures of SAS with pen (year) serving as experimental unit. From days 0 to 7, ADG was reduced (P = 0.01) for surgical (-0.42) compared to band (0.43 kg/d) castration. Conversely, ADG was increased for surgical (1.74) vs. band (1.46 kg/d) castration from days 14 to 32. There was also an overall (day 0 to final) improvement in ADG for MEL (P = 0.02), but no effect of castration method was observed (P = 0.81). The CON group had the greatest (P = 0.05) marbling score. Backfat thickness was increased (P = 0.01) for MEL. A treatment x day interaction (P = 0.04) existed for serum haptoglobin, with SUR having the greatest (P < 0.01) concentration on days 1 and 4. Meloxicam administered in the surgically castrated treatment reduced (P = 0.01) serum haptoglobin concentration on day 1. Relative to baseline, standing duration for surgical castration was increased 113 min (P < 0.01), while banding caused 6.7 more lying bouts (P < 0.01) immediately following castration on day 0. Step count was greatest for BAN, intermediate for CON, and least for surgical (P < 0.01). Results suggest that MEL mitigated the more pronounced inflammation observed for surgical castration, whereas behavior was differentially altered for castration method indicative of a divergent pain response. Castration, regardless of method, transiently reduced ADG, but MEL administration improved overall ADG for both methods.",2.2568143487393985e-4,2.2568143451353736e-4,2.2568143458333528e-4,2.2568143442832348e-4,2.2568143449665413e-4,2.2568143445041072e-4,2.2568143479108826e-4,2.2568143459626534e-4,2.2568143460272076e-4,0.9968404599148668,2.256814348904941e-4,2.2568143473508694e-4,2.2568143458452736e-4,2.256814349513466e-4,2.2568143463550801e-4
10,101016japplanim201610011,"Behavioural tests are often used to describe dogs' responses to a variety of stimuli. However, the expressed behaviours do not always give an accurate indication of the dogs' mental state. Cardiac measures can be recorded in parallel to the behavioural test to provide additional information about arousal level. Heart rate (HR) reflects the combination of sympathetic and parasympathetic stimulation, whereas the beat-to-beat variation in heart rate (heart rate variability: HRV) provides more details about the balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic activation. In studies validating cardiac measures typically the dog's movement is controlled or the response to only one stimulus at a time is tested. In this study, the validity and reliability of cardiac measures were tested during a behavioural test at home (N = 18 shepherd dogs). HR, HRV and behaviour were recorded in six randomised subtests, in which stimuli of different emotional valences were presented (neutral, positive, negative). Positive and negative subtests differed significantly from the neutral subtests in terms of HR and behaviour (P=0.000). Compared to the neutral subtests (77.85 +/- 21.00 bpm), HR was increased (positive: 91.67 +/- 21.64 bpm; negative: 100.29 +/- 18.54 bpm), and the dogs showed more interactions with the presented stimuli (contact/avoid, approach, look), more oral behaviours and were more active (walk, stand, less lying). However, HR only significantly correlated with activity during the neutral subtest (r = 0.511, P=0.030). Hence, activity only appeared to influence HR in the absence of significant emotional stimuli, whereas the increased HR in both the positive and negative subtests reflected arousal. This is supported by the fact that stress-related behaviours and HR were similar in dogs tested a second time (test-retest reliability; N=15 dogs), despite significant differences in activity between both test moments (Z = -2.510; P= 0.009). For the HRV variables, on the other hand, no significant differences were found between subtests of different emotional valences. This was possibly caused by errors in recording, due to poor electrode conduction caused by movement of the dogs. In conclusion, this study showed that HR can be a useful measure of arousal during behavioural tests, though it did not allow for a distinction between positive and negative emotional valences. HRV appeared more difficult to record (with the Polar (R) RS800CX with Wearlink) during constant movement of the dog. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

10,101016japplanim201406011,"Group housing of dairy calves with automated milk feeders has likely welfare and labour saving advantages but delays in the calves adapting to the feeding system may reduce these advantages. We examined factors that influence calves' adaptation to the feeders. In Exp. 1, 77 Holstein calves were reared in individual ""baby"" pens with free access to milk from a teat attached to a bucket for 5-6 d after birth. Milk intakes and weight gains were recorded and accelerometers measured the time spent standing. After 6 d, the calves were introduced to group pens with automated feeders. Latency to the first voluntary milk ingestion, milk intakes and weight gains were recorded. In the group pens, approx. 70% of calves ingested milk during the first voluntary visit to the milk feeder, but a large variation was found in the latency to the first voluntary ingestion of milk (10-240 h). Milk intakes were significantly lower on the first day in the group pen than in the baby pens (P<0.001) and milk intake over 14d in the group pens was negatively correlated with the latency to the first voluntary milk intake in the group pen (r = -0.29, P = 0.02). Latency to the first voluntary milk intake in the group pen was negatively correlated with body weight at introduction to the group pen (r = -0.25, P = 0.05) and the duration of standing in the baby pen (r = -0.30, P = 0.02). In Exp. 2, 55 Holstein calves were housed for 8-14d after birth either individually in single baby pens or as pairs in double baby pens (with milk supplied ad libitum through teats attached to buckets) and then transferred to group pens (as in Exp. 1). There were no differences between calves housed in single or double baby pens on the latency to first voluntary milk intake after group housing (P > 0.10). The latency to first voluntary milk ingestion in the group pens was negatively correlated with milk intake over 6 d in the group pens (r = -0.38, P = 0.03). When data from the two experiments were combined, latency to the first milk intake in the group pens was negatively correlated with age at time of introduction to the group pens (r = -0.23, P = 0.009) and duration of standing in the baby pens (r = -0.21, P = 0.02). There are large differences between calves in how quickly they learn to use automated milk feeders and a delay in learning to use the feeder is associated with lower milk intakes over 1-2 weeks. Pair housing immediately after birth did not help. Younger calves at the time of introduction are more likely to take longer to adapt than older calves but many 6 d old calves adapt quickly, especially those that show high vigour in the first week after birth.

10,101016japplanim201405003,"Tension-band castration of cattle is gaining favour because it is relatively simple to perform and is promoted by retailers of the devices as a humane castration method. Furthermore, retailers encourage delaying castration to exploit the superior growth rates of bulls compared with steers. Two experiments were conducted, under tropical conditions, comparing tension banding and surgical castration of weaner (7-10 months old) and mature (22-25 months old) Bos indicus bulls with and without pain management (ketoprofen or saline injected intramuscularly immediately prior to castration). Welfare outcomes were assessed using a wide range of measures; this paper reports on the behavioural responses of the bulls and an accompanying paper reports on other measures. Behavioural data were collected at intervals by direct observation and continuously via data loggers on the hind leg of the bulls to 4 weeks post-castration. Tension-banded bulls performed less movement in the crush/chute than the surgically castrated bulls during the procedures (weaner: 2.63 vs. 5.69, P < 0.001; mature: 1.00 vs. 5.94; P<0.001 for tension-band and surgical castration, respectively), indicating that tension banding was less painful then surgical castration during conduct. To 1.5 h post-castration, tension-banded bulls performed significantly (all P< 0.05) more active behavioural responses indicative of pain compared with surgical castrates, e.g., percentage time walking forwards (weaner: 15.0% vs. 8.1%; mature: 22.3% vs. 15.1%), walking backwards (weaner: 4.3% vs. 1.4%; mature: 2.4% vs. 0.5%), numbers of tail movements (weaner: 21.9 vs. 1.4; mature: 51.5 vs. 39.4) and leg movements (weaner: 12.9 vs. 0.9; mature: 8.5 vs. 1.5), respectively. In contrast, surgically castrated bulls performed more immobile behaviours compared with tension-banded bulls (e.g., standing in mature bulls was 56.6% vs. 34.4%, respectively, P=0.002). Ketoprofen administration appeared effective in moderating pain-related behaviours in the mature bulls from 1.5 to 3 h, e.g., reducing abnormal standing (0.0% vs. 7.7%, P=0.009) and increasing feeding (12.7% vs. 0.0%, P= 0.048) in NSAID- and saline-treated bulls, respectively. There were few behavioural differences subsequent to 24 h post-castration, but some limited evidence of chronic pain (3-4 weeks post-castration) with both methods. Interpretation, however, was difficult from behaviours alone. Thus, tension banding is less painful than surgical castration during conduct of the procedures and pain-related behavioural responses differ with castration method (active restlessness in response to tension banding and minimisation of movement in response to surgical castration). Ketoprofen administered immediately prior to castration was somewhat effective in reducing pain, particularly in the mature bulls. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Barbary macaques (Macaca sylvanus) are one of the few primates that live outside the tropics. Here we analyze if and how the activity budgets of Barbary macaques are affected by climatic variables, i.e., air temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, and snow coverage. We collected scan sampling data on the activity budgets of four groups of macaques living in the Middle Atlas Mountains of Morocco from June 2008 to January 2011. This habitat is characterized by extreme seasonal changes, from cold and snowy winters to hot and dry summers. The activity budgets of the macaques differed across months but not across the time of day (with the exception of time spent feeding). The monkeys spent significantly more time feeding or foraging when there was no snow than when snow coverage was moderate or major. Daily rainfall was positively related to resting time and negatively to time spent moving or in social behavior. Air temperature was negatively related to time spent feeding or foraging. Finally, time spent on social behavior was significantly lower when relative humidity was high. These data indicate that environmental factors significantly affect the time budgets of endangered Barbary macaques, a species that has been little studied in the wild.

We used automated radiotelemetry to provide the first detailed tests of the hypothesis that the nocturnal activity of free-ranging snakes should be influenced by temperature, moon phase, and prey abundance by using data for Ratsnakes (Pantherophis spp.) from Texas and Illinois. Ratsnakes exhibited some nocturnal behavior throughout their active season in both Texas and Illinois, although snakes were much more active at night in Texas than in Illinois. Texas snakes transitioned from primarily diurnal activity to primarily nocturnal activity over this snake's active season, whereas Illinois snakes were always most active in the middle of the day. For both populations, nocturnal activity was positively related to temperature but unrelated to moon phase. Ratsnakes in Texas exhibited a stepwise increase in nocturnal activity in mid-summer, independent of temperature and coincident with the shift in their diet to almost exclusively mammals active at night. Given the ability of snakes in both populations to be active at night when temperatures allow, warming climates could lead to an increase in nocturnal activity, with consequences for both the snakes and the species on which they prey.",3.4129560725664544e-4,3.412956068065865e-4,3.412956070742932e-4,3.4129560694408855e-4,3.4129560730852945e-4,3.4129560667367276e-4,3.4129560696883975e-4,3.412956065264387e-4,3.4129560690347537e-4,3.412956065907624e-4,0.9952218615033902,3.412956066759738e-4,3.412956067419348e-4,3.4129560734861257e-4,3.412956067898822e-4
11,101111j17447429201200853x,"Most animals have well established diel activity patterns (e.g., diurnal, crepuscular, or nocturnal), and changes in behavior from diurnal to nocturnal are rare in single species. We radio tracked 50 keelback snakes in a single population, locating them up to four times a day, over five periods of the year in the Australian dry tropics to describe temporal variation in diel movement patterns. Snake body temperatures were also recorded to determine the relationship between activity patterns and body temperatures. Season influenced diel activity patterns significantly. Keelbacks were more likely to move, and moved further in the daytime in the mid-dry (JuneJuly), and late dry (AugSep) seasons. In the mid-dry season, 87 percent of movements were diurnal, whereas in the mid-wet (FebMarch) season, although snakes were much more likely to move, only 43 percent of movements were diurnal. In the late dry season, snakes were slightly more likely to move at night than at any other time of day, and so at this time of the year, snakes could be classified as nocturnal. Thus, overall increased movements in the mid-wet season (austral summer) were associated with more crepuscular and nocturnal movement. There was a significant relationship between individual snake body temperatures and movement rates in all seasons. Changes in movement patterns may be related to body temperature, and this diurnal species becomes cathemeral in the tropics in summer, when it is possible to maintain high body temperatures both day and night.",3.905950236472611e-4,3.9059502304069e-4,3.9059502304637875e-4,3.905950228575416e-4,3.905950242876654e-4,3.90595023417548e-4,3.9059502297974054e-4,3.905950229181584e-4,3.905950228003706e-4,3.905950228729493e-4,0.9945316696766909,3.905950228406503e-4,3.9059502264130716e-4,3.9059502285409046e-4,3.905950231046116e-4
11,nodoi5766491235,"How animals allocate their time to various activities has significant consequences for their survival because they reflect the different constraints on time-energy balances. Many ecological variables, such as day length, temperature, food availability, are supposed to effect on activity budgets allocation of temperate primates. To examine the potential influence of these three variables, the activity budgets of Rhinopithecus bieti was studied at Xiaochangdu, Tibet from June 2003 to March 2005. Pearson correlations were utilized to assess potential relationships between activity budget and day length, food availability and temperature, and stepwise multiple regressions to identify the priority of resting and other activities (activities besides feeding, moving and resting). Time spent resting and doing ""other activities"" is positively related to day length, temperature and food availability. No significant correlations were found between feeding/moving time and any of these variables. This suggests that foraging time (feeding + moving) takes priority over rest and other activities. Day length and foraging time (as independent variables) were related to the time spent in the other two activities besides feeding/moving (as dependent variables). Both time spent resting and in ""other activities"" were highly significant positive functions of day length, with the latter a highly significant negative function of feeding time and moving time. Resting time may therefore be interpreted as taking priority over ""other activities"" time.

We studied its over-wintering strategy by comparing the diet, ranging, and behavior of a troop of 24 individuals during winter and spring (December 2005 to May 2006) through instantaneous scan sampling (3,002 records, 448 scans, 112hr of observation). We also monitored the phenology of food plants. The macaques spent more time (41-66%) feeding in the winter than in spring (33-51%), whereas time spent moving and resting was greater in spring. The diet composed largely of plants, with animal matter being eaten rarely. The number of plant species in the diet increased from 18 to 25 whereas food types rose from 18 to 36 from winter to spring, respectively. Although only two species formed 75% of the winter diet, seven species comprised this proportion in spring. Availability of fruits and young leaves increased in spring; the troop moved more and utilized a larger part of its range during this time. Seasonal changes in behavior could be explained by the scarcity of food and the costs of thermoregulation in winter. Our study suggests that the Arunachal macaque inhabits a highly seasonal environment and has an over-wintering strategy that includes subsisting on a high-fiber diet by increasing the time spent feeding, and minimizing energy expenditure by reducing the time spent moving.

This orientation was then compared to the observed orientation of nocturnal migration. Additionally, the orientation of the birds engaged in morning flights following nights with drifting winds was compared to that of birds following nights with non-drifting winds. The morning flights of most birds at our observation site were oriented to the west-northwest, following the southern coast of Lake Erie. Given that nocturnal migration was oriented generally east of north, the orientation of morning flight necessarily reflected compensation for accumulated, seasonal wind drift resulting from prevailingly westerly winds. However, the orientation of morning flights was similar following nights with drifting and non-drifting winds, suggesting that birds on any given morning were not necessarily re-orienting as an immediate response to drift that occurred the previous night. Given the topographical characteristics of our observation area, the west-northwest movement of birds in our study is likely best explained as a more complex interaction that could include some combination of compensation for wind drift, a search for suitable stopover habitat, flying in a direction that minimizes any loss in progressing northward toward the migratory goal, and avoidance of a lake crossing.",1.950402529471328e-4,1.950402527921997e-4,1.9504025285950311e-4,1.9504025285981596e-4,1.9504025253603088e-4,1.9504025253433362e-4,1.950402526975639e-4,1.950402530697659e-4,1.9504025275089812e-4,1.950402526637672e-4,1.9504025261196499e-4,0.9972694364616286,1.9504025281673535e-4,1.9504025267125076e-4,1.950402525604974e-4
12,101007s0026501824470,"Billions of migrating birds travel between their breeding and over-wintering areas twice a year, encountering various environmental conditions along their migration routes. Wind is of utmost importance for birds as wind speed and direction may strongly affect the birds' flight speed and metabolism. Specifically, tailwinds were found to initiate flight and facilitate higher migration intensity and faster migratory movement while lowering the energetic cost of flight. Using radar, field observations and local meteorological measurements, we studied spring migrating raptors in a migration bottleneck in Italy near the Strait of Messina, between Sicily and Calabria. We explored the effects of wind on flight speed and the intensity of migration in soaring migrants. We found that the birds' ground speed was positively affected by tailwind speed, and thus, tailwind likely allowed the birds to reach their destination faster. In addition, bird airspeed decreased under increasing tailwind speed, presumably lowering the energetic cost of flight. These findings are in line with predictions of optimal migration flight theory, yet, tailwind had an unexpected negative effect on migration intensity. We suggest that tailwind conditions induced a change in route selection by the migrants at a regional scale, causing a local decline in migration intensity. This change involves the undertaking of cross sea flight rather than overland detour. Furthermore, we found a modular response to crosswinds as birds compensated for winds blowing towards the sea and drifted when winds blew towards land. Our findings suggest that migrating raptors respond to en route wind conditions and coastline geography by adjusting several features of their flight in a manner that will increase their travel speed, reduce the energetic cost of flight, and permit a safe journey.
Significance statement
Soaring birds exploit tailwinds to move faster and presumably to reduce the energetic cost of flight during migration. Using radar, we tested how bird flight is affected by tailwind and further predicted that the due to the advantages of using tailwinds, as increased number of birds migrating over the study area. We found that radar-tracked migrating birds flew faster with tailwinds over the study area, but despite this advantage, surprisingly low number of birds migrated when tailwinds prevailed. Furthermore, birds seem to drift with winds blowing from the sea to the land, but not in the opposite direction, suggesting that birds try to avoid drifting over the sea where it is riskier to fly. Hence, our study highlights the complexity of migrant flight behavior in relation to the wind and suggests a flexible response to different wind conditions and coastline geography at multiple spatiotemporal scales.",2.843037836410364e-4,2.843037836178493e-4,2.843037833523284e-4,2.843037834354206e-4,2.843037833195486e-4,2.843037834309031e-4,2.8430378348277504e-4,2.8430378378839814e-4,2.843037835773663e-4,2.843037839350087e-4,2.843037836003773e-4,0.9960197470299644,2.843037836391574e-4,2.8430378374510594e-4,2.843037834703416e-4
12,101093behecoaru148,"The behavioral decisions of migratory songbirds during migration stopovers can markedly influence the pace, efficiency, and success of migration. An individual's fuel stores are considered in theory to directly dictate subsequent stopover behavior (e.g., extent of foraging or vigilance, when to depart), although such decisions at stopover must also consider atmospheric factors (e.g., wind, precipitation) that influence the energetic costs of migration. We conducted the first study to date that directly manipulated the fuel stores of newly arrived songbirds at a stopover site, evaluated their effect on movement behavior and departure decisions, and assessed how atmospheric factors mediated these behavioral decisions. Hermit thrushes (Catharus guttatus) captured during fall migration at a southern New England, USA, offshore island stopover site and subsequently released with increased fuel stores moved less and made more tortuous movements, were more likely to depart on a given night and regularly resumed migration earlier and in a seasonally appropriate direction relative to individuals released with little change in fuel stores. The importance of fuel stores in modifying behavioral decisions increased throughout the migration period, presumably in response to declining food abundance. Precipitation suppressed migrant movements during stopover and precluded departure. Migrants departed in light winds with little respect to wind direction. The pervasive influence of fuel stores on migrant stopover behavior underscores the central role of fuel acquisition in the dynamics, speed, and success of migration, as well as the importance of quality stopover sites to migratory birds.Songbirds typically punctuate migration with stopovers to rest and refuel. During stopover, migrants must balance finding food and staying safe, suggesting that fuel (fat) reserves govern behavioral priorities. We experimentally manipulated the fat stores of hermit thrushes newly arrived to a stopover site. Thrushes with larger fat stores moved less, resumed migration sooner, and used a more direct route than individuals with smaller fat stores; environmental conditions additionally modified thrush movements and departure decisions.",2.349075366631583e-4,2.3490753619692905e-4,2.349075363232319e-4,2.3490753615291744e-4,2.349075369100288e-4,2.349075363911677e-4,2.3490753667953381e-4,2.349075363481946e-4,2.3490753640678568e-4,2.349075361335075e-4,2.3490753645065006e-4,0.9967112944909972,2.3490753609881342e-4,2.3490753601972548e-4,2.349075362281574e-4
12,101371journalpone0035548,"To maximize fitness, flying animals should maximize flight speed while minimizing energetic expenditure. Soaring speeds of large-bodied birds are determined by flight routes and tradeoffs between minimizing time and energetic costs. Large raptors migrating in eastern North America predominantly glide between thermals that provide lift or soar along slopes or ridgelines using orographic lift (slope soaring). It is usually assumed that slope soaring is faster than thermal gliding because forward progress is constant compared to interrupted progress when birds pause to regain altitude in thermals. We tested this slope-soaring hypothesis using high-frequency GPS-GSM telemetry devices to track golden eagles during northbound migration. In contrast to expectations, flight speed was slower when slope soaring and eagles also were diverted from their migratory path, incurring possible energetic costs and reducing speed of progress towards a migratory endpoint. When gliding between thermals, eagles stayed on track and fast gliding speeds compensated for lack of progress during thermal soaring. When thermals were not available, eagles minimized migration time, not energy, by choosing energetically expensive slope soaring instead of waiting for thermals to develop. Sites suited to slope soaring include ridges preferred for wind-energy generation, thus avian risk of collision with wind turbines is associated with evolutionary trade-offs required to maximize fitness of time-minimizing migratory raptors.",3.244343113882989e-4,3.244343104152799e-4,3.244343140036309e-4,3.244343107854008e-4,3.244343116029706e-4,3.2443431278773426e-4,3.244343113459772e-4,3.2443431052257317e-4,3.2443431118796257e-4,3.2443431028398586e-4,3.244343115665316e-4,0.9954579196421393,3.2443431018773164e-4,3.244343104270122e-4,3.2443431135566653e-4
12,101016janbehav201005023,"We investigated the orientation in relation to wind of common swifts, Apus apus, during nocturnal spring and autumn migration. Swifts are highly adapted to a life in the air, showing wind-dependent orientation during nocturnal roosting flights, and may be expected to be more efficient in their wind drift/compensation behaviour than nocturnal passerine migrants, which are usually subjected to full or partial wind drift. A tracking radar at Lund in southern Sweden was used to record the orientation of common swifts (identified by their characteristic radar echo signature) on nocturnal migration flights and to measure wind conditions at the altitudes at which the birds were flying. Comparing track and heading directions under easterly and westerly winds revealed that the swifts shifted their heading distinctly into the wind, with the result that track directions were similar under the different wind conditions. As this pattern of complete compensation for drift from cross-winds occurred during both spring and autumn migration, there were no indications of differences between age classes. In addition, we found an effect of side-winds on equivalent airspeeds, with swifts increasing their airspeed with increasing wind speed. Such a response has been theoretically predicted as part of an optimal behaviour for counteracting wind drift but has hereto not been empirically demonstrated. There was also a positive correlation between overall wind speed and equivalent airspeed, making it difficult to interpret whether the swifts respond to the total wind speed rather than specifically to the side-wind effect. Our results suggest that important differences may exist between species in their capacities to orient in relation to the wind and that the swift may be particularly efficient in adjusting heading direction and airspeed to obtain complete compensation for wind drift during high-altitude nocturnal migratory flights.

The current investigation examined the right and left leg control differences interlateral asymmetries during static single leg stance and dynamic goal directed kicking with an emphasis of the asymmetrical stabilization and mobilization components of movements. Ten young, healthy, right-leg preferred individuals with minimal kicking experience completed both tests on each limb. During static single leg stance, participants were requested to stand as still as possible with one leg in contact with a force platform. Interlateral asymmetries of the standing leg were quantified using postural variability measures of the center of pressure (COP) standard deviation in the anterior-posterior (SD-COPAP.) and medial-lateral (SD-COPML) directions, resultant COP length and velocity, and 95% COP elliptical area. During dynamic goal directed kicking, participants stood on two adjacent force platforms in a side-by-side foot position and kicked a soccer"" ball toward three different directions as soon as they received an auditory cue of kicking. Three targets were located -degrees 30, 0 degrees or 30 degrees in front and 3.05 m away from the participants' midline. Participants kicked the ball toward the targets with each of their feet. The vertical ground reaction force (vGRF) of the kicking leg was used to define the preparation (from above two standard deviations of vGRF baseline to toe-off) and swing (from toe-off to toe-return) phases of dynamic kicking. To determine the presence of interlateral asymmetries during dynamic kicking, the magnitude and timing of the anticipatory postural adjustments (APA) during the preparation phase of kicking were quantified using the lateral net COP (COPnet-ML) time series derived from both force platforms. Postural variability measures of the support leg and the kinematic joint range of motion (JROM) trajectories of the kicking leg were also used to examined interlateral asymmetries. During static stance, no between-leg significance was identified for all dependent measures of COP variability suggesting symmetrical stabilization. During the preparation phase of kicking, both right and left leg kicking exhibited a similar level of APA magnitude, although the left leg kicking was shown to reach its maximum APA magnitude earlier than the right leg. In the support leg role, the right leg showed greater COP variability in the ML direction as compared to the left support leg and greater COP variability was observed when kicking in the ipsilateral direction compared to the center and contralateral directions. For mobilization control, the left kicking leg showed greater JROM displacements at the distal (knee and ankle) joints and reduced JROM primarily with hip frontal plane movements compared to the right kicking leg. The reported interlateral asymmetries during kicking may reflect a behavioral adaptation that results in differential stabilization between the right and left legs. Overall, the findings suggest that novel tasks, such as dynamic goal directed kicking, appear to be more sensitive than static balance in identifying interlateral asymmetries.",1.9098855487484717e-4,1.9098855501628663e-4,1.9098855475191217e-4,1.9098855535961982e-4,1.909885550547326e-4,1.9098855491242816e-4,1.9098855479090146e-4,1.9098855503232553e-4,1.9098855490311262e-4,1.9098855529501443e-4,1.9098855515084062e-4,1.9098855471136837e-4,0.9973261602305207,1.909885548528735e-4,1.9098855477307162e-4
13,101371journalpone0164990,"This study compared the movement demands of elite international Under-20 age grade (U20s) and senior international rugby union players during competitive tournament match play. Forty elite professional players from an U20 and 27 elite professional senior players from international performance squads were monitored using 10Hz global positioning systems (GPS) during 15 (U20s) and 8 (senior) international tournament matches during the 2014 and 2015 seasons. Data on distances, velocities, accelerations, decelerations, high metabolic load (HML) distance and efforts, and number of sprints were derived. Data files from players who played over 60 min (n = 258) were separated firstly into Forwards and Backs, and more specifically into six positional groups; FR-Front Row (prop & hooker), SR-Second Row, BR-Back Row (Flankers & No. 8), HB-Half Backs (scrum half & outside half), MF-Midfield (centres), B3-Back Three (wings & full back) for match analysis. Linear mixed models revealed significant differences between U20 and senior teams in both the forwards and backs. In the forwards the seniors covered greater HML distance (736.4 +/- 280.3 vs 701.3 +/- 198.7m, p = 0.01) and severe decelerations (2.38 +/- 2.2 vs 2.28 +/- 1.65, p = 0.05) compared to the U20s, but performed less relative HSR (3.1 +/- 1.6 vs 3.2 +/- 1.5, p < 0.01), moderate (19.4 +/- 10.5 vs 23.6 +/- 10.5, p = 0.01) and high accelerations (2.2 +/- 1.9 vs 4.3-2.7, p < 0.01) and sprint center dot min(-1) (0.11 +/- 0.06 vs 0.11 +/- 0.05, p < 0.01). Senior backs covered a greater relative distance (73.3 +/- 8.1 vs 69.1 +/- 7.6 m center dot min(-1), p < 0.01), greater High Metabolic Load (HML) distance (1138.0 +/- 233.5 vs 1060.4 +/- 218.1m, p < 0.01), HML efforts (112.7 +/- 22.2 vs 98.8 +/- 21.7, p < 0.01) and heavy decelerations (9.9 +/- 4.3 vs 9.5 +/- 4.4, p = 0.04) than the U20s backs. However, the U20s backs performed more relative HSR (7.3 +/- 2.1 vs 7.2 +/- 2.1, p < 0.01) and sprint center dot min(-1) (0.26 +/- 0.07 vs 0.25 +/- 0.07, p < 0.01). Further investigation highlighted differences between the 6 positional groups of the teams. The positional groups that differed the most on the variables measured were the FR and MF groups, with the U20s FR having higher outputs on HSR, moderate & high accelerations, moderate, high & severe decelerations, HML distance, HML efforts, and sprints center dot min(-1). For the MF group the senior players produced greater values for relative distance covered,HSR, moderate decelerations, HML distance and sprint center dot min(-1). The BR position group was most similar with the only differences seen on heavy accelerations (U20s higher) and moderate decelerations (seniors higher). Findings demonstrate that U20s internationals appear to be an adequate 'stepping stone' for preparing players for movement characteristics found senior International rugby, however, the current study highlight for the first time that certain positional groups may require more time to be able to match the movement demands required at a higher playing level than others.

13,101371journalpone0128571,"In a competitive sport, the outcome of a game is determined by an athlete's relationship with an unpredictable and uncontrolled opponent. We have previously analyzed the preparatory state of ground reaction forces (GRFs) dividing non-weighted and weighted states (i.e., vertical GRFs below and above 120% of body weight, respectively) in a competitive ballgame task and demonstrated that the non-weighted state prevented delay of the defensive step and promoted successful guarding. However, the associated kinetics of lower extremity joints during a competitive sports task remains unknown. The present study aims to investigate the kinetic characteristics of a real-time competitive sport before movement initiation. As a first kinetic study on a competitive sport, we initially compared the successful defensive kinetics with a relatively stable preparatory state and the choice-reaction sidestep as a control movement. Then, we investigated the kinetic cause of the outcome in a 1-on-1 dribble in terms of the preparatory states according to our previous study. The results demonstrated that in successful defensive motions in the non-weighted state guarding trial, the times required for the generation of hip abduction and three extension torques for the hip, knee, and ankle joints were significantly shortened compared with the choice-reaction sidestep, and hip abduction and hip extension torques were produced almost simultaneously. The sport-specific movement kinetics emerges only in a more-realistic interactive experimental setting. A comparison of the outcomes in the 1-on-1 dribble and preparatory GRF states showed that, in the non-weighted state, the defenders guarded successfully in 68.0% of the trials, and the defender's initiation time was earlier than that in the weighted state (39.1%). In terms of kinetics, the root mean squares of the derivative of hip abduction and three extension torques in the non-weighted state were smaller than those in the weighted state, irrespective of the outcome. These results indicate that the preparatory body state as explained by short-term joint torque fluctuations before the defensive step would help explain the performance in competitive sports, and will give insights into understanding human adaptive behavior in unpredicted and uncontrolled environments.",2.6774460456522784e-4,2.6774460428208107e-4,2.6774460375509224e-4,2.677446041584123e-4,2.677446036547858e-4,2.677446036140417e-4,2.677446037891447e-4,2.6774460428445e-4,2.677446038599822e-4,2.677446041527685e-4,2.677446038009595e-4,2.6774460391526506e-4,0.9962515755445159,2.6774460391898415e-4,2.677446037328373e-4

The reliability of the various maximum strength and ballistic assessment methodologies were reported in the form of intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) and coefficient of variation (% CV). Mean percent differences Mdiff= [vertical bar X-method1-X-method2 vertical bar/(X-method1-X-method2) X 100)and effect size (ES = [X-method2 -X-method1] divided by SDmethod1) calculations were used to assess the magnitude and spread of methodological differences for a given performance measure of the included studies. Studies were grouped and compared according to their respective performance measure and movement pattern. The various measurement systems (e. g. force plates, position transducers, accelerometers, jump mats, optical motion sensors and jump-andreach apparatuses) and assessment procedures (i.e. warm-up strategies, loading schemes and rest periods) currently used to assess maximum isometric squat and mid-thigh pull strength (ICC[0.95; CV < 2.0 %), 1RM bench press, back squat and clean strength (ICC[0.91; CV < 4.3 %), and ballistic (vertical jump and bench throw) capabilities (ICC[0.82; CV < 6.5 %) were deemed highly reliable. The measurement systems and assessment procedures employed to assess maximum isometric strength [M-Diff = 2-71 %; effect size (ES) = 0.13-4.37], 1RM strength (M-Diff = 1-58 %; ES = 0.01-5.43), vertical jump capabilities (M-Diff = 2-57 %; ES = 0.02-4.67) and bench throw capabilities (M-Diff = 7-27 %; ES = 0.49-2.77) varied greatly, producing trivial to very large effects on these respective measures. Recreational to highly trained athletes produced maximum isometric squat and mid-thigh pull forces of 1,000-4,000 N; and 1RM bench press, back squat and power clean values of 80-180 kg, 100-260 kg and 70-140 kg, respectively. Mean and peak power production across the various loads (body mass to 60 % 1RM) were between 300 and 1,500 W during the bench throw and between 1,500 and 9,000 W during the vertical jump. The large variations in maximum strength and power can be attributed to the wide range in physical characteristics between different sports and athletic disciplines, training and chronological age as well as the different measurement systems of the included studies. The reliability and validity outcomes suggest that a number of measurement systems and testing procedures can be implemented to accurately assess maximum strength and ballistic performance in recreational and elite athletes, alike.

13,1021651153140000000000000000,"Australian Football, the most popular football code in Australia, is a contact sport played by two teams of 18 players who contest play over four 20-minute quarters; the object of the game is to score the most points through goal kicking. Sixteen professional senior sides compete against each other in the Australian Football League (AFL) and, similar to other football codes, game demands at the elite level in the AFL have changed considerably in recent years. Early time-motion analysis studies highlighted the long periods of time players spent in low intensity activities (standing and walking). While recent studies utilizing global positioning systems (GPS) technology are somewhat in agreement with earlier findings, available evidence suggests that the game is getting faster. For example, 'playing on' after a mark (a feature of the game where players who catch the ball on the full from a kick longer than 15 m are awarded a free kick) is now much quicker. Indeed, rule changes in recent years have increased the flow and speed of the game; there has been a reduction in the time taken for umpires to restart play, and for players to kick-in (after the opposition kicks a behind) or take a set shot at goal. Nomadic players (a broad term for midfielders and ruckmen because they follow play over the entire playing field) cover slightly greater distances (12 310 m) than both forwards (11 920 m) and backs (11 880m) in a game. Compared with players in other positions, midfielders are consistently found to spend the most time at higher intensities (running and sprint efforts with movement velocities >4.44 m/sec), complete more high intensity efforts (similar to 98 per game), sustain them for longer and have shorter recovery periods between high intensity exercise bouts (similar to 90 seconds on average). 'Ruckmen' have similar but less intense running profiles, while forwards and backs generally have less game involvement but have a more intermittent running profile (longer recovery periods with shorter duration high intensity exercise bouts and less time spent in constant pace running). Endurance fitness remains very important for players at the elite level of competition, as does upper and lower body strength and power. In addition, given the increasing speed at which Australian Football is now played, repeated sprint ability of players is arguably more important now than it was in previous years. There are no significant differences in these measures between playing position. Similarly, speed over 10-40 m does not appear to differ between playing position. Establishing the reliability of distance and velocity-derived GPS data in highly specific game-related activities is needed; once achieved, GPS data have the potential to accurately inform coaches of the position-specific demands on their players and to drive the development of training practices that reflect the changing demands of the game.",2.010102761592661e-4,2.0101027596322748e-4,2.0101027570630458e-4,2.0101027603968365e-4,2.010102760627881e-4,2.0101027593046587e-4,2.0101027589249887e-4,2.0101027642182418e-4,2.0101027638466694e-4,2.010102757503165e-4,2.010102759050271e-4,2.010102757358402e-4,0.99718585613646,2.0101027585388393e-4,2.0101027573410916e-4

Children spend a significant portion of their days in sedentary behavior (SB) and on average fail to engage in adequate physical activity (PA). The school built environment may influence SB and PA, but research is limited. This natural experiment evaluated whether an elementary school designed to promote movement impacted students' school-time SB and PA.
Methods
Accelerometers measured SB and PA at pre and post time-points in an intervention group who moved to the new school (n = 21) and in a comparison group experiencing no school environmental change (n = 20). Difference-in-difference (DD) analysis examined SB and PA outcomes in these groups. Measures were also collected post-intervention from an independent, grade-matched group of students in the new school (n = 21).
Results
As expected, maturational increases in SB were observed. However, DD analysis estimated that the intervention attenuated increase in SB by 81.2 +/- 11.4 minutes/day (p<0.001), controlling for time in moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA). The intervention was also estimated to increase daily number of breaks from SB by 23.4 +/- 2.6 (p<.001) and to increase light physical activity (LPA) by 67.7 +/- 10.7 minutes/day (p<0.001). However, the intervention decreased MVPA by 10.3 +/- 2.3 minutes/day (p<0.001). Results of gradematched independent samples analysis were similar, with students in the new vs. old school spending 90.5 +/- 16.1 fewer minutes/day in SB, taking 21.1 +/- 2.7 more breaks from SB (p<0.001), and spending 64.5 +/- 14.8 more minutes in LPA (p<0.001), controlling for time in MVPA. Students in the new school spent 13.1 +/- 2.7 fewer minutes in MVPA (p<0.001) than their counterparts in the old school.
Conclusions
This pilot study found that active school design had beneficial effects on SB and LPA, but not on MVPA. Mixed results point to a need for active classroom design strategies to mitigate SB, and quick access from classrooms to areas permissive of high-intensity activities to promote MVPA. Integrating active design with programs/policies to promote PA may yield greatest impact on PA of all intensities.",2.601679072216241e-4,2.6016790756386185e-4,2.601679072419665e-4,2.601679072555838e-4,2.601679072611027e-4,2.601679076448055e-4,2.601679070537609e-4,2.601679073323293e-4,2.601679071555949e-4,2.601679073916665e-4,2.601679090523294e-4,2.601679074168058e-4,2.601679072587021e-4,0.9963576492961161,2.601679070338245e-4

The evidence regarding the unique effect of sedentary behaviour on obesity among children is unclear. Moreover, the effect of substituting sedentary behaviour with physical activity of different intensities on the body composition of children has received limited empirical study.
Objective
To examine the mathematical effects on Body Mass Index (BMI) of substituting sedentary behaviours with physical activities of different intensities on children and youth aged 5-14 years old in New Zealand.
Methods
Secondary analysis of accelerometer data from the National Survey of Children and Young People's Physical Activity and Dietary Behaviours in New Zealand (2008/09) was conducted. A total of 1812 children and youth aged 5-24 years provided accelerometer-derived data on daily sedentary time (SB), light intensity physical activity (LPA) and moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Sleep time was assessed with a validated computerised use-of-time tool. BMI was assessed using anthropometric measurements. Multiple linear regression models were used to examine the independent associations of SB, Sleep time, LPA, and MVPA on BMI. The isotemporal substitution approach was used to ascertain the mathematical effect of substituting each of the other behaviours on BMI. Analyses were stratified by age groups.
Results
SB showed a unique (inverse) association with BMI across all age groups (p<0.05) but 20-24 years (p>0.05). Similarly, MVPA was positively associated (p<0.001) across all age groups. Among age groups 5-9 years, 10-14 years and 15-19 years, the estimated impact of replacing 60 min/day of SB with the same amount of MVPA time resulted in decreased BMI for all age groups (p<0.001), ranging from -1.26 (5-9 years) to -1.43 units (15-19 years). Similar results were achieved when SB was replaced with LPA or sleeping time for children (5-19 years). In young people (age group 20-24), the impact of replacing 30 min/day of SB with MVPA resulted in an estimated -1 BMI units decrease (p<0.001).
Conclusion
MVPA and SB have a unique effect on BMI. Further, substituting SB with LPA or MVPA was associated with a favourable effect on BMI across all age groups; with MVPA having the strongest association.",2.3856483188264356e-4,2.385648322435271e-4,2.3856483186687565e-4,2.385648319123647e-4,2.3856483230291645e-4,2.3856483182206053e-4,2.3856483155314733e-4,2.3856483171587776e-4,2.3856483162798677e-4,2.3856483193877658e-4,2.3856483171659932e-4,2.3856483154866413e-4,2.3856483185894046e-4,0.9966600923543806,2.3856483162910735e-4

Animal studies have suggested that maternal weight-related factors during pregnancy can program offspring physical activity in a sex-dependent manner. However, there is limited evidence in humans. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between maternal gestational weight gain (GWG) and offspring total physical activity (TPA) level and to determine whether these associations are moderated by sex of offspring or maternal pre-pregnancy weight status.
Method
We studied 56 boys (mean age = 3.7 years, standard deviation (SD) 0.5) and 57 girls (mean age = 3.5 +/- 0.5 years) enrolled in licensed childcare centers. TPA was objectively measured using Actical (R) accelerometers. Information on pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), GWG, and other maternal factors were collected with a maternal health questionnaire. Associations between GWG, as a continuous variable or categorically (inadequate, adequate, and excessive), and offspring TPA were analysed using linear mixed models to take into account the intraclass correlation between the clusters (childcare centers). Models were adjusted for gestational age, accelerometer weartime, socioeconomic status, and pre-pregnancy BMI status.
Results
We found a significant sex interaction (P-value = 0.009). In boys, greater GWG was associated with decreased offspring TPA (beta = -3.2 counts.1000(-1)/d, 95% confidence intervals (CI) = -6.4-0.02, P-value = 0.049). In girls born to mothers categorized as overweight or obese, the association between the GWG and TPA followed an inverted U-shape curve (beta for GWG squared = -0.1 counts.1000(-1)/d, 95% CI = (-0.2 --0.04), P-value = 0.005). In contrast, a U-shaped curve was found in girls born to mothers classified as lean (pre-pregnancy BMI<25 kg/m(2)) (beta for GWG squared = 0.7 counts.1000(-1)/d, 95% CI = 0.2-1.2, P-value = 0.011). In boys, TPA in offspring was higher among women with inadequate GWG compared to adequate GWG (P-value = 0.0137), whereas no significant differences were found in girls (P-value = 0.107).
Conclusion
Maternal GWG can be an important biological marker of offspring TPA. These findings support the sex-dependent early developmental programming influence of GWG on TPA.",2.4623204830795105e-4,2.4623204867692646e-4,2.462320490401183e-4,2.462320489475231e-4,2.4623204772573226e-4,2.462320475431286e-4,2.462320479468455e-4,2.4623204840582057e-4,2.4623204749164477e-4,2.462320487320114e-4,2.4623204785414527e-4,2.462320477545823e-4,2.462320479629421e-4,0.9965527513257376,2.462320478730214e-4

Physical activity is known to significantly impact cardiometabolic health. Accelerometer data, as a measure of physical activity, can be used to objectively identify a disparity in movement (movement discordance) between healthy and unhealthy adults. The purpose of this study was to examine the Movement Discordance between healthy and unhealthy adults in a large US population sample.
Methods
Demographic, health and accelerometer data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Study (NHANES) 2003-2004 and 2005-2006 cohorts were used for this study. Participants were classified as either having a ""normal"" or ""abnormal"" value for each cardiometabolic health parameter examined, based on published criteria. Linear regression analyses were performed to determine significance of each abnormal health parameter (risk factor) in its unique effect on the accelerometer counts, controlling for age and gender. Average accelerometer counts per minute (cpm) by gender and age categories were estimated separately for the groups of normal and abnormal cardiometabolic risk.
Results
Average cpm for those with healthy levels of each individual cardiometabolic health parameter range from 296 cpm (for C reactive protein) to 337 cpm (for waist circumference), while average cpm for those with abnormal levels of each individual cardiometabolic health parameter range from 216 cpm (for insulin) to 291 cpm (for LDL-cholesterol). After controlling for age and gender, waist circumference, HbA1c, Insulin, Homocysteine, and HDL-Cholesterol were the cardiometabolic health parameters that showed significant, unique and independent effects on cpm. Overall, individuals who have abnormal values for all significant cardiometabolic health parameters (""unhealthy"") averaged 267 cpm (SE = 15 cpm), while the healthy sample of this study averaged 428 cpm (SE = 10 cpm). The difference in cpm between the unhealthy and healthy groups is similar between males and females. Further, for both males and females, the cpm gap between unhealthy and healthy is largest in the 30s (males: 183 cpm; females 144 cpm) and lessens as age increases, with the lowest gap seen in those 80+ years (males, 81 cpm; females, 85 cpm).
Conclusion
This Movement Discordance between healthy and unhealthy adults represents a gap in movement that needs to be closed to improve the health of individuals with, or at risk for cardiometabolic disease.",2.544084609962842e-4,2.544084615469939e-4,2.5440846088931843e-4,2.5440846129010336e-4,2.544084609829729e-4,2.5440846073376594e-4,2.544084608358591e-4,2.5440846087619644e-4,2.5440846082985124e-4,2.5440846103985876e-4,2.544084609981864e-4,2.5440846072587447e-4,2.544084610616846e-4,0.9964382815464126,2.5440846078041536e-4
14,101371journalpone0104677,"Background: As cardio-metabolic risk tracks from childhood to adulthood, a better understanding of the relationship between movement behaviors (physical activity, sedentary behavior and sleep) and cardio-metabolic risk in childhood may aid in preventing metabolic syndrome (MetS) in adulthood.
Objective: To examine independent and combined cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between movement behaviors and the MetS score in 8-11 year old Danish children.
Design: Physical activity, sedentary time and sleep duration (seven days and eight nights) were assessed by accelerometer and fat mass index (fat mass/height(2)) was assessed using Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. The MetS-score was based on z-scores of waist circumference, mean arterial blood pressure, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, triglycerides and high density lipoprotein cholesterol. All measurements were taken at three time points separated by 100 days. Average of the three measurements was used as habitual behavior in the cross-sectional analysis and changes from first to third measurement was used in the longitudinal analysis.
Results: 723 children were included. In the cross-sectional analysis, physical activity was negatively associated with the MetS-score (P<0.03). In the longitudinal analysis, low physical activity and high sedentary time were associated with an increased MetS-score (all P<0.005); however, after mutual adjustments for movement behaviors, physical activity and sleep duration, but not sedentary time, were associated with the MetS-score (all P<0.03). Further adjusting for fat mass index while removing waist circumference from the MetS-score rendered the associations no longer statistically significant (all P. 0.17). Children in the most favorable tertiles of changes in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, sleep duration and sedentary time during the 200-day follow-up period had an improved MetS-score relative to children in the opposite tertiles (P = 0.005).
Conclusion: The present findings indicate that physical activity, sedentary time and sleep duration should all be targeted to improve cardio-metabolic risk markers in childhood; this is possibly mediated by adiposity.",2.572559530013185e-4,2.572559527916366e-4,2.572559524965245e-4,2.5725595286469314e-4,2.572559524743161e-4,2.5725595235271027e-4,2.572559523865275e-4,2.572559527316099e-4,2.5725595290509323e-4,2.5725595290625614e-4,0.00025725595265832627,2.5725595235900065e-4,2.5725595301162867e-4,0.9963984166625991,2.5725595246132326e-4

Current research efforts on sea turtles in the South China region mainly focus on captivity and husbandry, haematology and blood chemistry, and nesting ecology. Published information on the marine habitat use of wild populations is limited. 2. This situation therefore creates a pressing need for scientific research on freeranging sea turtles as a foundation for habitat management and species protection in South China. In this study, habitat use and oceanic movement of nesting, and bycatch or stranded green turtles, were determined by satellite tracking combined with home-range analysis. 3. Coupled with previous findings, the foraging grounds of several sea turtle species (green turtle Chelonia mydas, hawksbill turtle Eretmochelys imbricata and loggerhead Caretta caretta) were mainly distributed along the coasts of Hainan Island Province and Guangdong Province, mainland China, as well as Taiwan and the Philippines, and the outlying islands in the South China Sea and East China Sea. 4. Habitat hot spots and migratory corridors of green turtles, in particular nesting turtles in South China, were identified. Coastal waters near Wanning City of Hainan Island, the eastern Leizhou Peninsula, Iriomote-jima and Ishigaki-shima of the Ryukyu Islands of Japan, and Dao Bach Long Vi of Vietnam serve as foraging grounds for nesting green turtles from different origins in South China. Moreover, the Paracel (Xisha) and the Pratas (Dongsha) Islands in the South China Sea, Huidong Gangkou, and its vicinity in mainland China, and Liouciou Island and Penghu Island of Taiwan contain both nesting sites and foraging grounds for green turtles. 5. The sites that are associated with migratory corridors, in particular Hainan Island, eastern Leizhou Peninsula, and Liouciou Island, which currently lack conservation plans for sea turtles, should be given higher priority for habitat and species protection.",2.774402530043397e-4,2.774402533809784e-4,2.774402535917634e-4,2.7744025362908334e-4,0.035065036730861324,2.774402536091541e-4,2.7744025333350765e-4,2.774402528013295e-4,2.774402532573341e-4,2.774402530458033e-4,2.774402532492666e-4,2.7744025314607897e-4,2.774402529600419e-4,2.774402529402641e-4,0.9613282399771897
15,103354meps12136,"Sea turtles congregate in specific in-water habitats during reproductive periods. These habitats are inherently tied to the location of their nesting beaches, but they are also influenced by the prevailing oceanographic conditions. Here, we characterized the movements and diving behaviour of leatherback turtles Dermochelys coriacea between nesting events at the iSimangaliso Wetland Park, South Africa. Furthermore, we characterized the general oceanographic features (sea surface temperature and ocean currents) in and around the identified internesting habitats. To achieve this, we deployed satellite transmitters onto 10 inter-nesting leatherback turtles. Many of these turtles were tracked over multiple inter-nesting intervals; in total, we collected data over 25 inter-nesting intervals. Inter-nesting turtles generally stayed within 100 km of the coastline, but they moved large distances north and south, covering approximately 600 km of the coast. Even though sea surface temperatures increased notably over the nesting season, we did not observe any obvious change in the movement or diving patterns of leatherback turtles tracked over consecutive inter-nesting intervals, suggesting that turtles were not selecting internesting habitats based on local sea surface temperature patterns. However, we propose that the fast-flowing Agulhas Current may provide a natural boundary for the movements of inter-nesting turtles. We hypothesize that inter-nesting turtles might be avoiding fast flowing waters to minimize energy expenditure or avoid being advected away from the nesting habitats.",3.490706123524504e-4,3.4907061244034506e-4,3.4907061224167467e-4,3.490706127005593e-4,3.490706127751161e-4,3.4907061301020455e-4,3.490706124856857e-4,3.490706120440837e-4,3.4907061200111113e-4,3.4907061195394785e-4,3.4907061212623825e-4,0.02773650334170375,3.4907061208949784e-4,3.4907061205230336e-4,0.967725578698023

Nine turtles subsequently nested at RS and demonstrated two inter-nesting strategies linked to the location of their residence sites. Three turtles used local shallow coastal sites within 60 km of RS during some or all of their inter-nesting periods and then returned to and settled at these sites on completion of their breeding seasons. In contrast, five individuals spent inter-nesting periods proximate to RS and then migrated to and settled at distant (> 350 km) shallow coastal residence sites.

15,101007s002270091216z,"This study is the first report of post-nesting migrations of loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) nesting in Sarasota County (Florida, USA), their most important rookery in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM). In total, 28 females (curved carapace length CCL between 82.2 and 112.0 cm) were satellite-tracked between May 2005 and December 2007. Post-nesting migrations were completed in 3-68 days (mean +/- A SD = 23 +/- A 16 days). Five different migration patterns were observed: six turtles remained in the vicinity of their nesting site while the other individuals moved either to the south-western part of the Florida Shelf (n = 9 turtles), the Northeast GOM (n = 2 turtles), the South GOM (Yucatan Shelf and Campeche Bay, Mexico, and Cuba; n = 5 turtles) or the Bahamas (n = 6 turtles). In average, turtles moved along rather straight routes over the continental shelf but showed more indirect paths in oceanic waters. Path analyses coupled with remote sensing oceanographic data suggest that most of long-distance migrants reached their intended foraging destinations but did not compensate for the deflecting action of ocean currents. While six out of seven small individuals (CCL < 90 cm) remained on the Florida Shelf, larger individuals showed various migration strategies, staying on the Florida Shelf or moving to long-distance foraging grounds. This study highlights the primary importance the Western Florida Shelf in the management of the Florida Nesting Subpopulation, as well as the need of multi-national effort to promote the conservation of the loggerhead turtle in the Western Atlantic.",3.490706125193409e-4,3.490706130672016e-4,0.049550432520181584,3.490706121884737e-4,3.4907061257475697e-4,3.4907061273464405e-4,3.490706126251681e-4,3.490706138522502e-4,3.490706124898564e-4,3.4907061235919546e-4,3.490706133635136e-4,3.4907061256182704e-4,3.490706122037547e-4,3.4907061218292316e-4,0.9459116495150954
