Stages of topic analysis.
</center>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The topics were not defined a priori.
Instead, we fitted Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) models to the abstracts
(<span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Blei2003" role="doc-biblioref">Blei, Ng, and Jordan</a> (<a href="#ref-Blei2003" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a>)</span>).</p>
<div id="the-model" class="section level3" number="3.1.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.1</span> The model</h3>
<p>LDAs are Bayesian mixture models that assume the existence of a fixed number <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>
of topics behind the abstracts.
Each topic can be characterized by a multinomial distribution of words with
parameter <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>, drawn from a Dirichlet distribution with parameter
<span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>.
Each document <span class="math inline">\(d \in {1, ..., D}\)</span> is composed by a mixture of topics, drawn
from a multinomial distribution with parameter <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>, which is drawn from a
Dirichlet distribution with parameter <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>.
For each word <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> in document <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>, first a hidden topic <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> is selected from the
multinomial distribution with parameter <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>.
From the selected topic <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>, a word is selected based on the multinomial
distribution with parameter <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>.
The log-likelihood of a document <span class="math inline">\(d = \{w_1,...,w_N\}\)</span> is
<span class="math inline">\(l(\alpha,\beta) = \log(p(d|\alpha,\beta)) = \log\int\sum_z\left[\prod_{n=1}^{N} p(w_i|z_i,\beta)p(z_i|\theta)\right]p(\theta|\alpha)d\theta\)</span></p>
<p>Here we used the LDA model with variational EM estimation (<span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Wainwright2008" role="doc-biblioref">Wainwright and Jordan</a> (<a href="#ref-Wainwright2008" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>)</span>, <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Blei2003" role="doc-biblioref">Blei, Ng, and Jordan</a> (<a href="#ref-Blei2003" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a>)</span>)
implemented in the <em>topicmodels</em> package. All the details of the model
specification and estimation are in <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Grun2011" role="doc-biblioref">GrÃ¼n and Hornik</a> (<a href="#ref-Grun2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The model assumes exchangeability (i.e.Â the order of words is negligible), that
topics are uncorrelated, and that the number of topics is known.</p>
<p>The most commonly used criterion to choose a number of topics is the perplexity
score or likelihood of a test dataset (<span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Waal2008" role="doc-biblioref">De Waal and Barnard</a> (<a href="#ref-Waal2008" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>)</span>).
Basically, this quantity measures the degree of uncertainty a language model has
when predicting some new text (for this study, a new abstract of a paper).
Lower values of the perplexity is good and it means the model is assigning
higher probabilities.
However, the perplexity score measures predictive capacities, rather than having
actual humanly-interpretable latent topics (<span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Chang2009" role="doc-biblioref">Chang et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-Chang2009" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a>)</span>).
In fact, using this score could result in there being too many topics; see
<span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Griffiths2004" role="doc-biblioref">Griffiths and Steyvers</a> (<a href="#ref-Griffiths2004" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a>)</span> who analyzed PNAS abstracts and obtained 300 topics.
Hence, we decided to fix the number of topics to 15, as a
reasonable value that would not be too large than we could not interpret them,
or too small that the topics were too general.</p>

<div id="preprocessing" class="section level3" number="3.1.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.2</span> Preprocessing</h3>
<p>To improve the quality of our LDA model outputs, we cleaned the data by 1)
removing redundant words for identifying topics (e.g.Â prepositions and
numbers), 2) converting all British English words to American English so they
would not be seen as different words, 3) lemmatizing (i.e.Â extracting the lemma
of a word based on its intended meaning, with the aim of grouping words under
the same lemma) (<span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Ingason2008" role="doc-biblioref">Ingason et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-Ingason2008" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>)</span>), 4) filtering out words that were only used once
in the whole set of abstracts. R packages <em>tidytext</em> (<span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Silge2016" role="doc-biblioref">Silge and Robinson</a> (<a href="#ref-Silge2016" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span>), <em>tm</em> and
<em>textstem</em> (<span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Rtextstem" role="doc-biblioref">Rinker</a> (<a href="#ref-Rtextstem" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>) were used in this <a href="R/02-CleaningWords_TopicModeling.R">stage (click to

</div>
<div id="model-fitting" class="section level3" number="3.1.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.3</span> Model fitting</h3>
<p>The parameter estimates of the LDA model were obtained by running 20 replicates
of the models (with the VEM estimation method), and keeping the one with the
highest likelihood; <a href="R/02-TopicModelingScript_rj.R">click here to download the
code</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="model-outputs" class="section level3" number="3.1.4">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.4</span> Model outputs</h3>
<p>From the fitted LDA model, we can obtained:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(E(\beta | z,w)\)</span>, as the posterior expected values of word distribution per
topic, denoted by <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\beta}\)</span>, and</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(E(\theta\_d | z)\)</span>, the posterior topic distribution per abstract, denoted
by <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> in the package.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\beta}\)</span> values were thus a proxy of the importance of a word in
a topic. They were used to interpret and label each topic, and to create
wordclouds for each topic, where the area occupied by each word was proportional
to its <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\beta}\)</span> value.</p>

</center>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> indicated the degree of association between an abstract and a topic,
we obtained a <a href="Data/Topics/sample_validation_top_Ntopics_15_method_VEM_II.csv">sample (click to
download)</a> of
the 5 most associated abstracts to each topic, to aid the interpretation of the
topics.</p>
<p>Based on these outputs, the topics were interpreted as: 1) Social interactions
and dispersal, 2) Movement models, 3) Habitat selection, 4) Detection and
data, 5) Home ranges, 6) Aquatic systems, 7) Foraging in marine megafauna,
8) Biomechanics, 9) Acoustic telemetry, 10) Experimental designs, 11) Activity
budgets, 12) Avian migration, 13) Sports, 14) Human activity patterns,
15) Breeding ecology. For an extended description of these topics, see the main text of the manuscript.</p>
<p>The sum of <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> values for each topic (<span class="math inline">\(\sum_d E(\theta_d | z_k)\)</span> for each <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>) served as proxies of the
âprevalenceâ of the topic relative to all other topics and were used to rank
them.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.5</span> Model assessment</h3>
<p>We assess the consistency and interpretation of the LDA results via internal and
external expert judgement, respectively.</p>
<div id="consistency" class="section level4" number="3.1.5.1">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.1.5.1</span> Consistency</h4>
<p>In the heatmap, we showed that most papers were more strongly associated to one
topic.
To check for consistency, for each topic, we compared its wordcloud with one
obtained from abstracts that were highly associated with the topic
(<span class="math inline">\(\gamma &gt; 0.75\)</span>).
The two wordclouds should be telling a very similar story, thus visually
resemble, with very small differences due to the abstracts being composed âin
a small proportion âby other topics as well.
We selected the papers with <span class="math inline">\(\gamma &gt; 0.75\)</span>, and computed the number of
times each unique word occurred in the abstracts related to the topic.
We divided those values by the total number of words in the topic to get a
relative frequency <span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span>.
We then created wordclouds for each topic, where the area occupied by each word
was proportional to its <span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span> value.

words were the same, and the words that differ provided complementary

<div id="interpretation" class="section level4" number="3.1.5.2">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.1.5.2</span> Interpretation</h4>
<p>To assess the interpretability of the topics, we performed a word intrusion
analysis, i.e.Â people are given the task to identify a word injected into the
topâterms of each topic.
For each topic, we identified the
<a href="Data/Topics/word_intrusion/word_intrusion_real.csv">4 highest-probability words (click to download)</a>,
i.e.Â with the highest <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\beta}\)</span> values.
We did not use a higher number of words in the word intrusion tests as we
considered that it could have required more effort from the researchers who
kindly and voluntarily participated in this process.
Then, we took a high-probability word from another topic âthat was not
âmovementâ or âbehaviorâ as they were highly related to most topics âand <a href="Data/Topics/word_intrusion/word_intrusion_test.csv">added
it to the group; download file with intruder here</a>.
We asked 10 researchers in the field to identify the intruder in each group of
words without any more explanations, and suggested them to answer fast so that they
would not have to overthink; their answers are
<a href="https://github.com/rociojoo/mov-eco-review/tree/master/Data/Topics/word_intrusion">here</a>.
We then computed the number of correct answers for each topic.
A high score for a topic would indicate that the topic was easy to interpret
using the 4 highest associated words to it.</p>
<p>The scores are shown in the table below.

<p>Topics 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 and 12 got high scores (&gt;7).
A few of the low-scored topics (<span class="math inline">\(\leq 5\)</span>) had a word intrusion that could be considered
relatively general for the researchers thus confusing, such as âtagâ (topic 4) and
âdataâ (topics 9 and 15).
Moreover, the two topics highly associated with humans, 13 and 14, also had low
scores that could be a consequence of the researchers (all ecologists) not
expecting any human related group.
Overall, this analysis shows that only half of the topics are easily
interpretable using the 4 highest-probability words.
Even for us, the researchers involved in this study, it was necessary to look
at the abstracts with the highest association to each topic in order to be sure
of the interpretation of some of the topics.</p>
<p>An alternative approach to model assessment in topics is through topic
prediction on an independent data set, but this should be performed when the
goal of the study is to predict over new data sets, which is not the case here.</p>
<p>The word intrusion approach is not an exhaustive assessment of topic
interpretability, but it allows putting our results into perspective: some
topics have a clear and easy interpretation and some others are really hard to
interpret.</p>

<div id="taxonomical-identification" class="section level2" number="3.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Taxonomical identification</h2>
<p>To identify the taxonomy of the organisms studied in the papers, the ITIS
(Integrated Taxonomic Information System) database (USGS Core Science Analytics
and Synthesis) was used to detect names of any animal species (kingdom Animalia)
that were mentioned in the abstracts, titles and keywords. We screened these
sections for latin and common (i.e., vernacular) names of species (both singular
and plural), as well as common names of higher taxonomic levels such as orders
and families. We excluded ambiguous terms that are used as common names for taxa
but also have a current language meaning; for example: âHere,â âScales,â
âCosta,â âRay,â etc. Because we wanted to consider humans as a separate
category, we excluded âHomo sapiensâ from the search terms, but used the
following non-ambiguous terms to identify papers that focus on movement ecology
of humans:</p>
<pre><code>&quot;player&quot;, &quot;players&quot;, &quot;patient&quot;, &quot;patients&quot;, &quot;child&quot;, &quot;children&quot;,
&quot;teenager&quot;, &quot;teenagers&quot;, &quot;people&quot;, &quot;student&quot;, &quot;students&quot;, &quot;fishermen&quot;, &quot;person&quot;,
&quot;tourist&quot;, &quot;tourists&quot;, &quot;visitor&quot;, &quot;visitors&quot;, &quot;hunter&quot;, &quot;hunters&quot;, &quot;customer&quot;,
&quot;customers&quot;, &quot;runner&quot;, &quot;runners&quot;, &quot;participant&quot;, &quot;participants&quot;, &quot;cycler&quot;,
&quot;cyclers&quot;, &quot;employee&quot;, &quot;employees&quot;, &quot;hiker&quot;, &quot;hikers&quot;, &quot;athlete&quot;, &quot;athletes&quot;,
&quot;boy&quot;, &quot;boys&quot;, &quot;girl&quot;, &quot;girls&quot;, &quot;woman&quot;, &quot;women&quot;, &quot;man&quot;, &quot;men&quot;, &quot;adolescent&quot;,
&quot;adolescents&quot;. </code></pre>
<p>In cases where words may be suffixes of larger words, we used
regular expression notation to exact match words, e.g âmanâ must match only the
word âmanâ and not âmanually.â We excluded words that could have an
ambiguous meaning: âpassengerâ may appear in papers that mention passenger
pigeons; âdriverâ may be used to refer to a causing factor.</p>
<p>After having identified any taxon mentioned in a paper, we summarized taxa at
the Class level (except for superclasses Osteichthyes and Chondrichthyes which
we merged into a single group labeled Fish, and for classes within the phylum
Mollusca and the subphylum Crustacea which we considered collectively). Thus,
each paper was classified as focusing on one or more class-like groups, as in
<span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Holyoak2008" role="doc-biblioref">Holyoak et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-Holyoak2008" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>)</span>: Fish, Mammals, Birds, Reptiles, Amphibians, Insects, Crustaceans,
Mollusks, and others. For the purpose of our analysis, we kept humans as a
separate category and did not count them within Class Mammalia.</p>
<p>The quality control procedure consisted in selecting a random sample of 100
abstracts and verifying that the common taxonomical group was correctly
identified. The accuracy was 93%. The code for taxonomical identification can be

<div id="movement-ecology-framework-mef" class="section level2" number="3.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Movement ecology framework (MEF)</h2>
<p>A unifying conceptual framework for movement ecology was proposed in
<span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Nathan2008" role="doc-biblioref">Nathan et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-Nathan2008" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>)</span>. It consisted of four components: external factors (i.e.Â the set of
environmental factors that affect movement), internal state (i.e.Â the inner
state affecting motivation and readiness to move), navigation capacity (i.e.Â the
set of traits enabling the individual to orient), and motion capacity (i.e.Â the
set of traits enabling the individual to execute movement). The outcome of the
interactions between these four components would be the observed movement path
(plus observation errors).</p>
<p>To assess the study of the different components of the movement ecology
framework, we built what we call here a âdictionary.â A dictionary is composed
of concepts and associated words. Here, the concepts of interest were the
components of the framework (i.e.Â internal state, external factor, motion and
navigation), and their associated words were the terms potentially used in the
abstracts to refer to the study of each component. For example, terms like
âmemory,â âsensory information,â âpath integrationâ or âorientationâ were used
to identify the study of navigation. The framework dictionary is <a href="Data/Dictionary/csv-updated-versions/Dictionaries-Framework.csv">downloadable here</a>.</p>
<p>To assessed how well the dictionary identified the components in the papers, a
quality control procedure was established. For each aspect, a random sample
of 100 papers was selected, and a coauthor who did not lead the construction of
the dictionary was randomly selected to check if in those papers the categories
of the dictionary were correctly identified (i.e.Â accuracy). The accuracy
was 91%.</p>
<p>We replicated this analysis for the 1999-2008 period for comparison purposes.</p>

<div id="tracking-devices" class="section level2" number="3.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> Tracking devices</h2>
<p>We grouped tracking devices in 11 categories. These categories were meant to be
as monophyletic as possible, and so broad categories had to be defined. Also,
use of one technology does not rule out the use of another technology. E.g.
radio + GPS is frequently used, and marine studies frequently have an array of
sensors on them that may combine multiple technologies. These categories are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Light loggers: Any technology that records light levels and derives locations based on the timing of twilight events.</li>
<li>Satellite: Any tag that collects location via, and sends data to, satellites, so that data can be accessed remotely. Frequently, the ARGOS system.<br />
</li>
<li>Radio telemetry: Any technology that infers location based on radio telemetry (VHF/UHF frequency). Sometimes it is used in addition to either light logger or GPS technology, though this distinction cannot be readily inferred using our methodology.</li>
<li>Camera: They include any device that records location/presence via photos
or video; mainly camera traps with known locations where the capture of the
individual implies the location.<br />
</li>
<li>Video: They include any device that records movement via video.<br />
</li>
<li>Acoustic: Any technology that uses sound to infer location, either in a similar way to radio telemetry or in an acoustic array where animal vocalizations are recorded and the location of sensors in the array are used to obtain an animal location.<br />
</li>
<li>Pressure: Any technology that records pressure readings (frequently in the water), and these changes infer vertical movement, such as through a water column.</li>
<li>Accelerometer: Any technology that is placed on a subject and measures the acceleration of the tag, and this delta infers movement.</li>
<li>Body conditions: Any technology that uses body condition sensors to collect data on the subject that may be associated with a movement or lack thereof, such as temperature and heart rate.<br />
</li>
<li>GPS: Any technology that uses Global Position System satellites to calculate the location of an object. Can be handheld GPS devices, or animal-borne tags.<br />
</li>
<li>Radar: Any technology that uses âradio detection and rangingâ devices to track objects. Can be large weather arrays or tracking radars.<br />
</li>
<li>Encounter: Any analog tracking method where the user must capture the subject and place a marker on the subject. The recapturing/resighting of the subject infers the movement. This category was difficult to capture in our study due to a lack of specific phrases that can be used.</li>
</ol>
<p>Their use was assessed with a dictionary approach. The dictionary can be downloaded <a href="Data/Dictionary/csv-updated-versions/Dictionaries-Data.csv">here</a>.</p>
<p>To assess how well the dictionary identified the types of devices in the papers, a quality control procedure was established. For each aspect, a random sample
of 100 papers was selected, and a coauthor who did not lead the construction of
the dictionary was randomly selected to check if in those papers the categories
of the dictionary were correctly identified (i.e.Â accuracy). The accuracy
was 84%.</p>
<p>To assess if we were identifying animal-borne GPS rather than hand-held GPS, we took a sample of 100
papers already associated to GPS according to our dictionary. 83 referred to GPS
tags, 12 were hand held, and 5 were neither tag nor hand-held (e.g.Â GPS coordinates in general, or General Practitioners).</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.6</span> Statistical methods</h2>
<p>Within our dictionary approach, we first used expert opinion to compile all known statistical methods (and terms used for them) that could have been used in movement ecology, resulting in 188 terms; <a href="Data/Dictionary/Methods-Classification.csv">click here to download the corresponding file</a>.
We classified statistical methods into Spatial, Time-series, Movement, Spatiotemporal, Social, and Generic. Their definitions are below:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Spatial: spatial statistical methods (e.g.Â geostatistics)</li>
<li>Time-series: time series methods (e.g.Â functional data analysis)</li>
<li>Movement: statistical method used for the study of movement (e.g.Â behavioral change point analysis)</li>
<li>Spatiotemporal: spatiotemporal but not movement methods (e.g.Â spatiotemporal geostatistics)</li>
<li>Social: statistical methods that are not exclusively for movement, but that characterize or model social processes (e.g.Â social networks)</li>
<li>Generic: generic statistical methods that could be used in any type of study, that are not inherently spatial, temporal or social (e.g.Â a regression analysis)</li>
</ol>
<p>Terms related to hypothesis tests were first considered but ultimately removed; we considered that the tendency of papers to present p-values could be biasing researchers towards the use of hypothesis tests, thus creating a bias towards general methods.</p>
<p>For quality control, we examined a random sample of 50 papers. The accuracy
