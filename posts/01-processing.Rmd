Workflow to identify movement ecology papers.

### What is a movement ecology paper?

We defined mov-eco papers as scientific peer-reviewed papers that studied the
voluntary movement of one or more living individuals. This included humans.

### Search keywords

  - We used Web of Science (WoS) as a search engine for the papers.

  - We defined mov-eco papers as scientific peer-reviewed papers that studied
    the voluntary movement of one or more living individuals. This included
    humans.
  
  - Very few papers mention "movement ecology" in their abstracts, so we did not
    use "movement ecology" as a search phrase. After much testing, we came up
    with the following groups of words:
  
    * Group 1 - Behavior: behavio
    * Group 2 - Movement: movement, moving, motion, spatiotemporal, kinematics, spatio-temporal
    * Group 3 - Biologging: telemetry, geolocat, biologg, accelerom, gps, geo-locat, bio-logg, 
    reorient, vhf, argos, radar, sonar, gls, vms, animal-borne
    * Group 4 - Individuals: animal, individual, human, person, people, player, wildlife, fishermen
    
    <br />
    
    Paper abstracts had to have words from at least 3 of the groups above to be selected. 
    Also, unless they had words from group 3, they could not contain:
    
    * Group 5 - Missleading words: cell, DNA, enzyme, strain, neurons, atom, molecule, lymph, 
    cortex, cortic, neurotransmi, patient prosthese, eye, particle, tectonic, counsel, cognit, 
    market, spine, questionnaire, sendentary, insulin
    
  <br />
    
The search on WoS was made over a final selection of [273
journals](posts/html/Journal_table_3col.html); made in
parallel with keyword tunning.

### Cleaning and filtering results in R

The grouping criteria were applied to the Topic field in WoS, which search the
Title, Abstract, and Keywords sections. We downloaded the search results from
WoS, which contain information on title, keywords, abstracts and authors, among
others. We downloaded all references in raw `.txt` format as it was the valid
input for the refsplitr package available for R (@R2018) on github
(<https://github.com/ropensci/refsplitr>) (@Rrefsplitr). Refsplitr reads in
multiple WoS files, parses addresses, and performs author matching. We used the
`references_read` function to compile the .txt files into one data sheet. To be
sure that the papers shown in our search in WoS were respecting our search
criteria for the abstracts, we applied the same filters described above to the
downloaded search results via R. In addition to the grouping criteria we
filtered by Document Type to only allow 'Articles','Proceedings Papers', and
'Reviews'. [Link to download code](R/01-download_process_fulltext.R)

8007 papers were obtained from this.

### Quality control
  
From the cleaned results, we took a random sample of 100 papers (i.e. with
title, abstracts and other features taken from WoS). We then read the abstracts
and classified them into "mov-eco" and "not mov-eco". If the percentage of
mov-eco papers (i.e. precision) was lower than 80%, the word criterion used for
the search would be improved (e.g. adding more words, editing some, changing the
rules for the groups). This is how we came up with the groups introduced above
(section 2.1). We obtained 90% of precision. That means that, from the papers
that we had, almost all of them were mov-eco papers.
  
We also wanted to obtain a recall or sensitivity rate to quantify, from the
universe of mov-eco papers in the literature, how many we had in our search
results. To get an exact number is an impossible task because if we could get
the "real" list of mov-eco papers in the literature, we would use it in the
first place. Instead, we looked at the list of papers published by the journal
Movement Ecology. 69% of them were in our list. An estimated sensitivity of 69%
and precision of 90% implies that though we did not get the whole population of
mov-eco papers in our set, from the set of papers that we have, there is a very
high certainty that they are mov-eco papers.
  
### Possible biases
 
We have no reason to believe that our searching criteria has introduced biases
to our results. The relatively short list of words is due to the fact that other
words we tried were actually reducing our precision, providing us many papers
that were not about movement ecology. Of course, it is always possible that we
forgot to try an important word. A possible bias could come from WoS: we were
not able to get papers that were not in WoS, which depends on WoS agreements.
  
### Differences with other approaches selecting and analyzing mov-eco papers
  
  - @Holyoak2008: Their goal was to find papers about movement of
    organisms or gametes, so their definition of movement ecology was somewhat
    broader than ours. We were inspired by their procedure, and tried the terms
    that they showed in the paper that would be consistent with our definition
    of mov-eco. Like us, they used WoS to build their literature dataset. They
    had a two-step criterion to select the papers. First, they screened the WoS
    for papers that contained their keywords. Then, they narrowed down the
    selection by excluding non-ecological journals from their initial results.
    Two of their coauthors decided on a list of 496 journals. We applied a
    similar procedure but using a modified set of keywords because we found
    their criteria to be too broad for our definition, and then two coauthors
    (R.J. and S.P.) decided on 273 journals. Among the remaining articles, they
    selected a random sample of 1000 papers for quality control, rating them as
    relevant or not. Their overall success rate (similar to our precision)
    was 77%.

  - @Fraser2018: They also used the WoS. In "Topics", they searched for
    "ecology" and either "movement", "migrat", "home range", "dispersal" or
    "track". Their combination of words was too vague in our opinion, and they
    did not mention any quality control (e.g. precision, recall, specificity,
    sensitivity) statistic.

## Downloading whole manuscripts

Downloading movement ecology papers.

<br />

We used the *fulltext* package (@Rfulltext) in R, using Elsevier,
Springer, Scopus, Wiley, BMC and PLOS one API keys. We downloaded the articles
we had access to, as xml or pdf documents. We downloaded a total of 4060
complete manuscripts, representing 51% of our list of mov-eco papers. [PASTE

## Extracting the Material and Methods (M&M) sections

Summary of procedure to extract Material and Methods section from each paper.

<br />

For some analyses (\@ref(analyses)), we needed the Material and methods
section of the manuscripts. We created codes for .xml and .pdf files [RJ: We
should put the links here], using the *xml2* (@Rxml2) and *tm*
(@Rtm) packages, respectively. They took account of the
structure of the papers in either format, and aimed at finding section names
related to "Methods", "Data" or "Statistical Analysis". Not all papers had an
M\&M section (e.g. reviews or perspective papers). We were able to extract 3674
M\&M sections (46% of mov-eco paper results and 90% of fully downloaded papers).
