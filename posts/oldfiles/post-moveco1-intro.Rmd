## 1. Abstract of the manuscript

Movement is fundamental to life, shaping population dynamics, biodiversity, and
ecosystem structure. Recent advances in tracking technology have enabled
fundamental questions about movement to be tackled, and the number of
publications in movement ecology has increased considerably over time. A decade
ago, a framework was proposed for the study of movement ecology, as a first step
for an integrative theory of organism movement (Nathan et al. 2008). This
movement ecology framework (MEF), published in a PNAS' special feature on
movement ecology, has been recognized in the literature as a milestone in the
field. Ten years after the publication of the MEF, we investigated the state of
research in movement ecology. In this work, we show a snapshot of the field and
its research topics, evaluate the impact of the MEF in the literature, and
assess changes in the use of technological devices, software and statistical
methods. To accomplish this task, we used a text mining approach to review
\> 8000 movement ecology published papers. We found that, while there have been
major technological changes in the decade (i.e. more use of GPS devices,
accelerometers and video cameras, and a convergence towards the use of R), the
focus remains on the same research questions, and more specifically, on the
effect of external factors such as the environment on movement and behavior. In
practice, the comprehensive approach from the MEF has not been integrated into
movement ecology research. Based on these results, we discuss the future of
movement ecology, whether if technology will continue to be the driving force in
the field, or if the field will rather transform, embrace the MEF and face the
challenges of interdisciplinarity.
