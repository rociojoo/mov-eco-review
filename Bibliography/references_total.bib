abstract = {Fisheries have major impacts on seabirds, both by changing food availability and by causing direct mortality of birds during trawling and longline setting. However, little is known about the nature and the spatial-temporal extent of the interactions between individual birds and vessels. By studying a system in which we had fine-scale data on bird movements and activity, and near real-time information on vessel distribution, we provide new insights on the association of a threatened albatross with fisheries. During early chick-rearing, black-browed albatrosses Thalassarche melanophris from two different colonies (separated by only 75 km) showed significant differences in the degree of association with fisheries, despite being nearly equidistant to the Falklands fishing fleet. Most foraging trips from either colony did not bring tracked individuals close to vessels, and proportionally little time and foraging effort was spent near ships. Nevertheless, a few individuals repeatedly visited fishing 
vessels, which may indicate they specialise on fisheries-linked food sources and so are potentially more vulnerable to bycatch. The evidence suggests that this population has little reliance on fisheries discards at a critical stage of its nesting cycle, and hence measures to limit fisheries waste on the Patagonian shelf that also reduce vessel attractiveness and the risk of incidental mortality, would be of high overall conservation benefit.},

abstract = {The life history characteristics of some elasmobranchs make them particularly vulnerable to fishing mortality; about a third of all species are listed by the IUCN as Threatened or Near Threatened. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) have been suggested as a tool for conservation of elasmobranchs, but they are likely to be effective only if such populations respond to fishing impacts at spatial-scales corresponding to MPA size. Using the example of the Celtic Sea, we modelled elasmobranch biomass (kg h(-1)) in fisheries-independent survey hauls as a function of environmental variables and 'local' (within 20 km radius) fishing effort (h y(-1)) recorded from Vessel Monitoring Systems data. Model selection using AIC suggested strongest support for linear mixed effects models in which the variables (i) fishing effort, (ii) geographic location and (iii) demersal fish assemblage had approximately equal importance in explaining elasmobranch biomass. In the eastern Celtic Sea, sampling sites that occurred in 
the lowest 10\% of the observed fishing effort range recorded 10 species of elasmobranch including the critically endangered Dipturus spp. The most intensely fished 10\% of sites had only three elasmobranch species, with two IUCN listed as Least Concern. Our results suggest that stable spatial heterogeneity in fishing effort creates de facto refugia for elasmobranchs in the Celtic Sea. However, changes in the present fisheries management regime could impair the refuge effect by changing fisher's behaviour and displacing effort into these areas.},

The measure does not depend on either the number of clusters analyzed nor the method of partitioning of the data and can be used to guide a cluster seeking algorithm.},

We also propose a pseudo‚Äìoutput-sensitive algorithm for computing the discrete Fr¬¥echet distance exactly. The complexity of the algorithm is a function of the complexity of the free-space boundary, which is quadratic in the worst case, but tends to be lower in practice. 1},

The model allows the amplitude of one of the two sequences to be scaled by any suitable amount and its offset adjusted appropriately. Two subsequences are considered similar if one can be enclosed within an envelope of a specified width drawn around the other. The model also allows non-matching gaps in the matching subsequences. The matching subsequences need not be aligned along the time axis. Given this model of similarity, we present fast search techniques for discovering all similar sequences in a set of sequences. These techniques can also be used to find all (sub)sequences similar to a given sequence. We applied this matching system to the U.S. mutual funds data and discovered interesting matches.},

However, it has been reported that there is more mimicry when people agree than when they disagree: when people want to express shared opinions and attitudes, they do so by displaying behavior that is similar to their interlocutors' behavior. In a conversation, mimicry occurs in order to gain acceptance from an interaction partner by conforming to that person's attitudes, opinions, and behavior. In this paper we describe how visual behavioral information expressed between two interlocutors can be used to detect and identify visual mimicry. We extract and encode visual features that are expected to represent mimicry in a useful way. In order to show that mimicry has indeed occurred, we calculate correlations between visual features extracted from the interactants and compare these against each other and against a baseline. We show that it is possible to visualize the occurrence of visual mimicry during the progress of a conversation which allows us to research in which situations and to what extent mimicry occurs.},

Originally studied by developmental psychologists, synchrony has now captured the interest of researchers in such fields as social signal processing, robotics and machine learning. This paper emphasizes the current questions asked by synchrony evaluation and the state-of-the-art related methods. First, we present definitions and functions of synchrony in youth and adulthood. Next, we review the non-computational and computational approaches of annotating, evaluating and modeling interactional synchrony. Finally, the current limitations and future research directions in the fields of developmental robotics, social robotics and clinical studies are discussed.},

  	abstract = {This chapter reviews tools for measuring movement coordination and its variability and draws attention to the capacity of enhanced technology in motion analysis for providing detailed measurements of the coordination among limb segments and joints of the body. The review is highly relevant for theorists of motor control interested in measuring movement coordination and its variability during complex actions with multiple degrees of freedom such as locomotion. Key differences in methodological assumptions in the literature on biomechanics and motor control are identified, such as in assumptions regarding the definition of phase angle used when describing coordination between two segments. Decisions in measurement protocol, such as whether conventional linear statistics or circular statistical techniques should be used, can greatly influence the level of variability found in coordination. Although the literature is currently focusing a lot of attention on continuous relative phase and vector coding techniques, no single idea technique exists for measuring coordination and its variability over time. Consequently, researchers need to be aware of the strengths and limitations of existing methods and should state the rationale for using particular methodologies in their research studies to help readers interpret what amount of variability in the data is likely due to measurement errors and discrepancies. Measuring coordination and its variability is an issue that continues to challenge researchers in the movement sciences.},

Recent criticisms of these methods have suggested the need for a sound theoretical rationale to explain performance behaviours, not just describe them. The aim of this article was to show how ecological dynamics provides a valid theoretical explanation of performance in team sports by explaining the formation of successful and unsuccessful patterns of play, based on symmetry-breaking processes emerging from functional interactions between players and the performance environment. We offer the view that ecological dynamics is an upgrade to more operational methods of performance analysis that merely document statistics of competitive performance. In support of our arguments, we refer to exemplar data on competitive performance in team sports that have revealed functional interpersonal interactions between attackers and defenders, based on variations in the spatial positioning of performers relative to each other in critical performance areas, such as the scoring zones. Implications of this perspective are also considered for practice task design and sport development programmes.},

In tennis, the unceasing to-and-fro displacements of a player about a "home" reference position, located in the middle of the baseline, are akin to those of an oscillator, and the reciprocal attending of both players establishes an informational linkage. Thus, theoretically, the displacement of the two players can be analysed as a system formed by two coupled non-linear oscillators. In such a system, relative phase has been shown to be an adept measure of the temporal synchronization between the oscillators. We hypothesized that relative phase is a relevant collective variable to characterize the relative motion of tennis players. Four players were videotaped and their displacements analysed. The results revealed just two stable patterns of synchronization, in-phase and anti-phase, as the players moved in the same or opposite directions, respectively. Moreover, relative phase showed two types of evolution within trials: either it remained stable at in-phase or anti-phase, or it exhibited transitions between these two modes. In accordance with our hypothesis, the results identified relative phase as a pertinent collective variable to represent both invariance and change in the relative displacements of tennis players. Such a finding opens new avenues for investigating dual sports.},

Methods for estimation of the entropy of a system represented by a time series are not, however, well suited to analysis of the short and noisy data sets encountered in cardiovascular and other biological studies. Pincus introduced approximate entropy (ApEn), a set of measures of system complexity closely related to entropy, which is easily applied to clinical cardiovascular and other time series. ApEn statistics, however, lead to inconsistent results. We have developed a new and related complexity measure, sample entropy (SampEn), and have compared ApEn and SampEn by using them to analyze sets of random numbers with known probabilistic character. We have also evaluated cross-ApEn and cross-SampEn, which use cardiovascular data sets to measure the similarity of two distinct time series. SampEn agreed with theory much more closely than ApEn over a broad range of conditions. The improved accuracy of SampEn statistics should make them useful in the study of experimental clinical cardiovascular and other biological time series.},

After recording these collective variables, we used sample entropy (SampEn) and cross-sample entropy (Cross-SampEn) measures to assess the regularity and synchronization of participant actions in teams. Results demonstrated clear age-related variations in effects on the collective performance measures analysed. In attacking phases, older and more experienced players occupied a greater surface area and displayed higher values of team width and stretch index. In defensive phases, significant differences were observed in team length and stretch index. Cross-SampEn analysis demonstrated a greater synchronization between offensive and defensive surface areas and team width in older age groups (U17 and U19 yrs). Data suggest how coaches can manipulate practice task constraints to enhance development of team tactical performance behaviours in developing footballers between 16 and 19 yrs of age.},

  	abstract = {This study investigated movement synchronization of players within and between teams during competitive association football performance. Cluster phase analysis was introduced as a method to assess synchronies between whole teams and between individual players with their team as a function of time, ball possession and field direction. Measures of dispersion (SD) and regularity (sample entropy - SampEn - and cross sample entropy - Cross-SampEn) were used to quantify the magnitude and structure of synchrony. Large synergistic relations within each professional team sport collective were observed, particularly in the longitudinal direction of the field (0.89. ¬±. 0.12) compared to the lateral direction (0.73. ¬±. 0.16, p{\textless}.01). The coupling between the group measures of the two teams also revealed that changes in the synchrony of each team were intimately related (Cross-SampEn values of 0.02. ¬±. 0.01). Interestingly, ball possession did not influence team synchronization levels. In player-team synchronization, individuals tended to be coordinated under near in-phase modes with team behavior (mean ranges between -7 and 5¬∞ of relative phase). The magnitudes of variations were low, but more irregular in time, for the longitudinal (SD: 18. ¬±. 3¬∞; SampEn: 0.07. ¬±. 0.01), compared to the lateral direction (SD: 28. ¬±. 5¬∞; SampEn: 0.06. ¬±. 0.01, p{\textless}.05) on-field. Increases in regularity were also observed between the first (SampEn: 0.07. ¬±. 0.01) and second half (SampEn: 0.06. ¬±. 0.01, p{\textless}.05) of the observed competitive game. Findings suggest that the method of analysis introduced in the current study may offer a suitable tool for examining team's synchronization behaviors and the mutual influence of each team's cohesiveness in competing social collectives. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Research is split into three separate areas of inquiry - movement models based on random walks, individual-based models based on optimal foraging theory, and a statistical modelling approach - which have developed without much productive contact. Here we review recent advances in modelling home range behaviour, focusing particularly on the problem of identifying mechanisms that lead to the emergence of stable home ranges from unbounded movement paths. We discuss the issue of spatiotemporal scale, which is rarely considered in modelling studies, as well as highlighting the need to consider more closely the dynamical nature of home ranges. Recent methodological and theoretical advances may soon lead to a unified approach, however, conceptually unifying our understanding of linkages among home range behaviour and ecological or evolutionary processes.},

Using the formulation we provide, PPA home ranges can be easily implemented in a Geographic Information System (GIS). The advantage of the PPA home range is the explicit consideration of temporal limitations on animalmovement. In discussion, we identify the PPA home range as a stand-alone measure of animal home range or as a way to augment existing home range techniques. Future developments are highlighted in the context of the usefulness of time geography for wildlife movement analysis.

Telemetry data are increasing in spatial and temporal detail and new methods are being developed to incorporate fine resolution data into home range delineation. We extended a previously developed home range estimation technique that incorporates theory from time geography, the potential path area (PPA) home range, to allow the home range to be defined at multiple spatial scales depending on the observed rate of movement within the data. The benefits of this approach are demonstrated with a simulation study, which uses multi-state correlated random walks to represent dynamic movement phases to compare the modified PPA home range technique with a suite of other home range estimation methods (PPA home range, kernel density estimation, Brownian bridges, and dynamic Brownian bridges). We used a case study on caribou (Rangifer tarandus) movement from northern Canada to highlight the value of this approach for characterizing habitat conditions associated with wildlife habitat analysis. We used a simple habitat covariate, percent forest cover, to explore the potential for misleading habitat estimates when home ranges do not include potentially visited locations (omission area) or include areas not possibly visited (commission area). We highlight the advantages of the dynamic PPA home range in the context of quantifying omission and commission areas in other home range techniques. Finally, we provide our R code for calculating dynamic PPA home range estimates. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Wildlife Society.},

This procedure ensures an effective reduction of the number of possible splits. The method may be applied to a dichotomous division, but is perfectly suitable also for a global division into any number of clusters. An informal indicator of the "best number" of clusters is suggested. It is a"variance ratio criterion" giving some insight into the structure of the points.

  	abstract = {Biologists have repeatedly rediscovered classical models from physics predicting collision rates in an ideal gas. These models, and their two-dimensional analogues, have been used to predict rates and durations of encounters among animals or social groups that move randomly and independently, given population density, velocity, and distance at which an encounter occurs. They have helped to separate cases of mixed-species association based on behavioural attraction from those that simply reflect high population densities, and to detect cases of attraction or avoidance among conspecifics. They have been used to estimate the impact of population density, speeds of movement and size on rates of encounter between members of the opposite sex, between gametes, between predators and prey, and between observers and the individuals that they are counting. One limitation of published models has been that they predict rates of encounter, but give no means of determining whether observations differ significantly from predictions. Another uncertainty is the robustness of the predictions when animal movements deviate from the model's assumptions in specific, biologically relevant ways. Here, we review applications of the ideal gas model, derive extensions of the model to cover some more realistic movement patterns, correct several errors that have arisen in the literature, and show how to generate confidence limits for expected rates of encounter among independently moving individuals. We illustrate these results using data from mangabey monkeys originally used along with the ideal gas model to argue that groups avoid each other. Although agent-based simulations provide a more flexible alternative approach, the ideal gas model remains both a valuable null model and a useful, less onerous, approximation to biological reality.},

Many techniques have been proposed for processing, managing, and mining trajectory data in the past decade, fostering a broad range of applications. In this article, we conduct a systematic survey on the major research into trajectory data mining, providing a panorama of the field as well as the scope of its research topics. Following a road map from the derivation of trajectory data, to trajectory data preprocessing, to trajectory data management, and to a variety of mining tasks (such as trajectory pattern mining, outlier detection, and trajectory classification), the survey explores the connections, correlations, and differences among these existing techniques. This survey also introduces the methods that transform trajectories into other data formats, such as graphs, matrices, and tensors, to which more data mining and machine learning techniques can be applied. Finally, some public trajectory datasets are presented. This survey can help shape the field of trajectory data mining, providing a quick understanding of this field to the community.},

We analyze cooperative management as a non-cooperative game, where deviations from cooperative harvesting are deterred by the threat of harvesting at non-cooperative levels for a fixed number of periods whenever the initial stock falls below a trigger level. We illustrate the sequential harvesting game with an application to the Northern Baltic salmon fishery. Cooperative harvesting yields participants substantial gains in terms of expected payoffs. The greatest gains accrue to the fleet harvesting the spawning stock, the actions of which are not observed by the competitor. An explanation for the prevalence of fish wars is provided: even if a cooperative agreement is reached, shocks in recruitment trigger phases of non-cooperative harvesting. Further, the cooperative solution can only be maintained when stock uncertainty is not too prevalent. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.},

  	abstract = {Motions of particles in fields characterized by real-valued potential functions, are considered. Three particular expressions for potential functions are studied. One, U, depends on the ith particle's location, r(i)(t) at times t(i). A second, V, depends on particle i's vector distances from others, r(i)(t) - r(j)(t). This function introduces pairwise interactions. A third, W, depends on the Euclidian distances, parallel to r(i) (t) - r(j) (t)parallel to between particles at the same times, t. The functions are motivated by classical mechanics. Taking the gradient of the potential function, and adding a Brownian term one, obtains the stochastic equation of motion dr(i) = -del U(r(i))dt - Sigma(j not equal i) del V(r(i) - r(j))dt + sigma dB(i) in the case that there are additive components U and V. The del denotes the gradient operator. Under conditions the process will be Markov and a diffusion. By estimating U and V at the same time one could address the question of whether both components have an effect and, if yes, how, and in the case of a single particle, one can ask is the motion purely random? An empirical example is presented based on data describing the motion of elk (Cervus elaphus) in a United States Forest Service reserve.},

	abstract = {Spectral signal analysis constitutes one of the most important and most commonly used analytical tools for the evaluation of neurophysiological signals. It is not only the spectral parameters per se (amplitude and phase) which are of interest, but there is also a variety of measures derived from them, including important coupling measures like coherence or phase synchrony. After reviewing some of these measures in order to underline the widespread relevance of spectral analysis, this report compares the three classical spectral analysis approaches: Fourier, Hilbert and wavelet transform. Recently, there seems to be increasing acceptance of the notion that Hilbert- or wavelet-based analyses be in some way superior to Fourier-based analyses. The present article counters such views by demonstrating that the three techniques are in fact formally (i.e. mathematically) equivalent when using the class of wavelets that is typically applied in spectral analyses. Moreover, spectral amplitude serves as an example to show that Fourier, Hilbert and wavelet analysis also yield equivalent results in practical applications to neuronal signals. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Past research has revealed that natural social interactions contain interactional synchrony. The present study describes new methods for measuring interactional syn- chrony in natural interactions and evaluates whether the behavioral synchronization involved in social interactions is similar to dynamical synchronization found generically in nature. Two methodologies, a rater-coding method and a computational video image method, were used to provide time series representations of the movements of the co-actors as they enacted a series of jokes (i.e., knock‚Äìknock jokes). Cross-spectral and relative phase analyses of these time series revealed that speakers' and listeners' movements contained rhythms that were not only correlated in time but also exhibited phase syn- chronization. These results suggest that computational advances in video and time series analysis have greatly enhanced our ability to measure interactional synchrony in natural interactions. Moreover, the dynamical synchronization in these natural interactions is commensurate with that found in more stereotyped tasks, suggesting that similar organi- zational processes constrain bodily activity in natural social interactions and, hence, have implications for the understanding of joint action generally.},

Although the most informative way of investigating and interpreting collective movement phenomena would be afforded by the collection of high-resolution spatiotemporal data from moving individuals, such data are scarce and are virtually non-existent for long-distance group motion within a natural setting because of the associated technological difficulties. Here we present results of experiments in which track logs of homing pigeons flying in flocks of up to 10 individuals have been obtained by high-resolution lightweight GPS devices and analysed using a variety of correlation functions inspired by approaches common in statistical physics. We find a well-defined hierarchy among flock members from data concerning leading roles in pairwise interactions, defined on the basis of characteristic delay times between birds' directional choices. The average spatial position of a pigeon within the flock strongly correlates with its place in the hierarchy, and birds respond more quickly to conspecifics perceived primarily through the left eye-both results revealing differential roles for birds that assume different positions with respect to flock-mates. From an evolutionary perspective, our results suggest that hierarchical organization of group flight may be more efficient than an egalitarian one, at least for those flock sizes that permit regular pairwise interactions among group members, during which leader-follower relationships are consistently manifested.},

Here we propose and test a biologically realistic and quantifiable biosonar movement interaction mechanism for echolocating bats based on spatial perceptual bias, i.e. actual sound field, a reaction delay, and observed motor constraints in speed and acceleration. We found that foraging pairs of bats flying over a water surface swapped leader-follower roles and performed chases or coordinated manoeuvres by copying the heading a nearby individual has had up to 500 ms earlier. Our proposed mechanism based on the interplay between sensory-motor constraints and delayed alignment was able to recreate the observed spatial actor-reactor patterns. Remarkably, when we varied model parameters (response delay, hearing threshold and echolocation directionality) beyond those observed in nature, the spatio-temporal interaction patterns created by the model only recreated the observed interactions, i.e. chases, and best matched the observed spatial patterns for just those response delays, hearing thresholds and echolocation directionalities found to be used by bats. This supports the validity of our sensory ecology approach of movement coordination, where interacting bats localise each other by active echolocation rather than eavesdropping.},

	abstract = {Group dynamics are a fundamental aspect of many species' movements. The need to adequately model individuals' interactions with other group members has been recognised, particularly in order to differentiate the role of social forces in individual movement from environmental factors. However, to date, practical statistical methods which can include group dynamics in animal movement models have been lacking. 2.We consider a flexible modelling framework that distinguishes a group-level model, describing the movement of the group's centre, and an individual-level model, such that each individual makes its movement decisions relative to the group centroid. The basic idea is framed within the flexible class of hidden Markov models, extending previous work on modelling animal movement by means of multi-state random walks. 3.While in simulation experiments parameter estimators exhibit some bias in non-ideal scenarios, we show that generally the estimation of models of this type is both feasible and ecologically informative. 4.We illustrate the approach using real movement data from 11 reindeer (Rangifer tarandus). Results indicate a directional bias towards a group centroid for reindeer in an encamped state. Though the attraction to the group centroid is relatively weak, our model successfully captures group-influenced movement dynamics. Specifically, as compared to a regular mixture of correlated random walks, the group dynamic model more accurately predicts the non-diffusive behaviour of a cohesive mobile group. 5.As technology continues to develop it will become easier and less expensive to tag multiple individuals within a group in order to follow their movements. Our work provides a first inferential framework for understanding the relative influences of individual versus group-level movement decisions. This framework can be extended to include covariates corresponding to environmental influences or body condition. As such, this framework allows for a broader understanding of the many internal and external factors that can influence an individual's movement.},

	abstract = {The movements of individuals ‚Äì at almost any scale ‚Äì are likely to depend on the behaviour of conspecifics. As an example, the movements of dispersing juveniles and their settling decisions may depend on the availability of mates and free territories, that is, both the presence and absence of other individuals. As another example, individuals can use the presence of conspecifics during foraging movements as an indicator of habitat quality. We develop a general statistical framework for identifying and characterizing conspecific influence on movements from tracking data acquired simultaneously from a set of potentially interacting individuals. We model conspecific attraction/repulsion through a functional response in which social behaviour is assumed to depend on proximity to other individuals. The model partitions variation in the functional response into a population component (common to all individuals), variation among individuals (modelled as random intercept-slope) and variation within an individual's trajectory (modelled through temporal autocorrelation). We present a Bayesian approach for the estimation of the model and illustrate its use with simulated movement data generated from a number of contrasting scenarios. We then apply the method to a case study on eagle owl Bubo bubo juvenile dispersal, demonstrating that individual movements are generally influenced by the presence of conspecifics, with the level of attraction decreasing with increasing proximity to other individuals. We further show that female eagle owls are more attracted to conspecifics than males, and both males and females are more attracted to females than to males.},

The movement of a group of animals is modeled as a multivariate Ornstein Uhlenbeck diffusion process in a high-dimensional space. Each individual of the group is attracted to a leading point which is generally unobserved, and the movement of the leading point is also an Ornstein Uhlenbeck process attracted to an unknown attractor. The Ornstein Uhlenbeck bridge is applied to reconstruct the location of the leading point. All movement parameters are estimated using Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling, specifically a Metropolis Hastings algorithm. We apply the method to a small group of simultaneously tracked reindeer, Rangifer tarandus tarandus, showing that the method detects dependency in movement between individuals.},

@article{Tania2012,
	abstract = {The dynamics of resource patches and species that exploit such patches are of interest to ecologists, conservation biologists, modelers, and mathematicians. Here we consider how social interactions can create unique, evolving patterns in space and time. Whereas simple prey taxis (with consumable prey) promotes spatial uniform distributions, here we show that taxis in producer-scrounger groups can lead to pattern formation. We consider two types of foragers: those that search directly ("producers") and those that exploit other foragers to find food ("scroungers" or exploiters). We show that such groups can sustain fluctuating spatiotemporal patterns, akin to "waves of pursuit." Investigating the relative benefits to the individuals, we observed conditions under which either strategy leads to enhanced success, defined as net food consumption. Foragers that search for food directly have an advantage when food patches are localized. Those that seek aggregations of group mates do better when their ability to track group mates exceeds the foragers' food-sensing acuity. When behavioral switching or reproductive success of the strategies is included, the relative abundance of foragers and exploiters is dynamic over time, in contrast with classic models that predict stable frequencies. Our work shows the importance of considering two-way interaction--i.e., how food distribution both influences and is influenced by social foraging and aggregation of predators.},

@article{Coglan2015,
	abstract = {While the economic and environmental benefits of fisheries management are well accepted, the costs of effective management in low value fisheries, including the research necessary to underpin such management, may be considerable relative to the total economic benefits they may generate. Co-management is often seen as a panacea in low value fisheries. Increasing fisher participation increases legitimacy of management decision in the absence of detailed scientific input. However, where only a small number of operators exist, the potential benefits of co-management are negated by the high transaction cost to the individual fishers engaging in the management process. From an economic perspective, sole ownership has been identified as the management structure which can best achieve biological and economic sustainability. Moving low value fisheries with a small number of participants to a corporate-cooperative management model may come close to achieving these sole ownership benefits, with lower transaction costs. In this paper we look at the applicability of different management models with industry involvement to low value fisheries with a small number of participants. We provide an illustration as to how a fishery could be transitioned to a corporate-cooperative management model that captures the key benefits of sole management at a low cost and is consistent with societal objectives.},

@article{Aburto2009,
	abstract = {In order to avoid conflicts when spatially explicit rules are implemented, it is critical to understand the spatial distribution of fishing effort, the migration patterns of fishermen and the use of temporary fishing camps. The migration of fishermen is a process shaped by historical patterns of resource availability, in addition to economic and political factors. We present an example in which a temporary fishing camp used for extraction of benthic resources (Loco: Concholepas concholepas) changed into a permanent one during the study period. Throughout the study period fishing effort (trips) was closely related to the productivity of the different fishing grounds, with more trips directed to the most productive areas. The conversion from a temporary to a permanent fishing camp did not improve the efficiency of the loco fishery, but did allow better access to alternative resources (surf clams) on nearby fishing grounds. The succession from simple shelters to a permanent 'caleta' is a common situation along the Chilean coast, motivated originally by resource availability and more recently by the creation of the TURF system. In??particular the TURF system converts temporary (resource driven) movements of fishermen into rigid stationary caletas, which creates a number of problems. Temporary fishing camps are common when fishing grounds are far from the base port, but they require specific administrative tools in order to achieve sustainable fisheries management. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Pauly2006,
	abstract = {The competition between large, industrial, and small-scale fisheries in the face of growing resource scarcity has led, in most parts of the world, to in- creased marginalisation of small-scale fisheries. However, the natural role of social scientists, who, given their expertise, should be informing mitigating ac- tivities, is often usurped by biologists and/or economists, as demonstrated here through a Google-based analysis. It is argued that this is based on social scien- tists: (1) neglecting in their field work key variables, such as catch levels, impor- tant to any understanding of fisheries; and (2) often conducting and reporting on locale-specific field work without attempting broader (and admittedly risky) gen- eralisations -- the elements of a ‚Äòmodel' -- that are imperative for actual policy making. The former claim is illustrated with an example from the South Pacific, and it is shown that one result of current practices is the further marginalisation of small-scale fishers. The latter claim is illustrated with an example of a general model, which contextualises and thus explains a wide variety of phenomena re- lated to migration within and into the small-scale fishing sector. An application of this ‚ÄòMalthusian overfishing model' to the rebuilding efforts following the Asian tsunami of December 2004 is then presented. Finally, the case is made that de- spite their present problems, the small-scale fisheries of the world, suitably gov- erned, are still our best hope for sustainable utilisation of coastal resources.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-Œ±-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ‚â§ 2.0 {\textbackslash}AA for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

We define and classify the different kinds of zeros that occur in ecological data and describe how they arise: either from 'true zero' or 'false zero' observations. After reviewing recent developments in modelling zero-inflated data sets, we use practical examples to demonstrate how failing to account for the source of zero inflation can reduce our ability to detect relationships in ecological data and at worst lead to incorrect inference. The adoption of methods that explicitly model the sources of zero observations will sharpen insights and improve the robustness of ecological analyses.},

Using the data collected by the ‚ÄúInstituto del Mar del Per√∫‚Äù (\{IMARPE\}) during a scientific survey in 2005, we present a statistical analysis that has as main goals: (i) to adapt to the characteristics of the sampled data, such as spatial dependence, high proportions of zeros and big size of samples; (ii) to provide important insights on the dynamics of the anchovy population; and (iii) to propose a model for estimation and prediction of anchovy biomass in the \{NHCS\} offshore from Per√∫. These data were analyzed in a Bayesian framework using the integrated nested Laplace approximation (\{INLA\}) method. Further, to select the best model and to study the predictive power of each model, we performed model comparisons and predictive checks, respectively.

In this study we present a Bayesian framework for determining location that uses all the data available, is flexible to all tagging techniques, and provides location estimates with built-in measures of uncertainty. Bayesian methods allow the contributions of multiple data sources to be decomposed into manageable components. We illustrate with two examples for two different location methods: satellite tracking and light level geo-location. We show that many of the problems with uncertainty involved are reduced and quantified by our approach. This approach can use any available information, such as existing knowledge of the animal's potential range, light levels or direct location estimates, auxiliary data, and movement models. The approach provides a substantial contribution to the handling uncertainty in archival tag and satellite tracking data using readily available tools.},

Estimates of directed movement were close to zero for most fish reaching a maximum magnitude of 5.3 nm day‚àí1 for the one fish that moved away from its release site. Diffusivity estimates were also low, ranging from near zero to 1000 nm2 day‚àí1. Low values of the estimated movement parameters are consistent with the restricted scale of the observed movement and the apparent fidelity of bigeye to geographical points of attraction. Inclusion of a time-dependent model of the variance in geolocation estimates reduced the variability of latitude estimates.

	abstract = {Tracking marine animals with electronic tags has become an indispensable tool in understanding biology in relation to movement. Combining light based geolocation estimates with an underlying movement model has proved helpful in reconstructing the most probable track of tagged animals. These tracks can be further improved by including the tag measured sea-surface temperature and matching it to external sea-surface temperature ({SST}) data. The current methodology for doing this in a state-space model requires that external sea-surface temperature be smoothed before it is used in the model, and further that its gradient field is pre-calculated. This two-step approach has a number of technical drawbacks, and the final statistical inference about the most probable track is consequently less convincing. This paper presents a new methodology (refer to as {UKFSST}) where all steps, including the {SST} smoothing, are handled within one coherent model. An additional benefit is that even the degree of smoothing, which was previously pre-determined and fixed, can now be optimally selected. {UKFSST} offers better handling of non-linearities in Kalman filter, and provides a statistically sound model for geolocation applications, as opposed to ad hoc {SST} matching approaches.},

Recent advances in light-based geolocation models have enabled better estimation of the geographical positions of tagged animals. In particular, {TrackIt}, a state-space model with the Kalman filter, uses only light data from a tag for estimating positions and does so independently of manufacturer calculations. This approach is a complete break from previous geolocation methodologies, which rely on manufacturer-processed positions as an input. In this paper, a unified model is presented to extend {TrackIt} to incorporate satellite sea-surface temperature ({SST}) matching, an approach that has been demonstrated to improve accuracy. The performance of various satellite {SST} imagery products is also evaluated by the comparison of {SST}-inclusive models against the basic {TrackIt} model using only light information. Three new model parameters (bias, error and smoothing radius) are introduced for handling {SST} observations. Analyses based on double-tagging comparisons show that the overall accuracy of {TrackIt} increases with the incorporation of {SST}, even when the resolution of the matching satellite product is rather coarse. At the same time, the model accuracy can decrease when the {SST} observations do not exhibit any strong trends, rendering {SST} matching less informative. The incorporation of {SST} within this generic and statistically sound modeling framework illustrates how {TrackIt} can readily be extended to utilize new data streams, such as geomagnetic data, which will become available with the next generation of archival tags.},

	abstract = {Abstract Solar geolocation is used to quantify the movements of animals tagged with sensors that record ambient light with respect to time. Global location sensor ({GLS}) tags are small, light, and present minimal drag or wing loading. They are affordable, and some can record data for several migratory cycles. These benefits mean they can be used in applications for which satellite tags are unsuitable. However, large errors in estimated locations can result if the sensor is obscured, especially around twilight, and sometimes the data obtained is unusable by existing methods of analysis due to this source of noise. This places limitations on the usefulness of solar geolocation in conservation and monitoring efforts. All existing methods of analysis are dependent on twilights being identifiable or faithfully recorded. Instead, the method introduced here depends on the overall pattern of day and night to calculate the likelihoods for a Hidden Markov Model, where the hidden states are geographic locations. We call this a ?twilight?free? method of light?based geolocation. This method quickly estimates locations from otherwise unusable noisy light data. We use examples to show that the method produces tracks that are comparable in accuracy and precision to other geolocation methods. Furthermore, efficiency and replicability of estimated paths are improved because the user does not have to subjectively identify twilights. Other data sources, such as sea surface temperature and land or sea masks are easily incorporated, further improving location estimates and processing speed. The twilight?free method offers new opportunities to researchers interested in the movements of animals that routinely have obscured sensors, or to analyse previously unusable noisy light data. It offers a fast, efficient, and replicable method for analysing tag data without the need for time?consuming pre? or post?processing. By increasing the yield of usable data from {GLS} tagging studies, researchers can more efficiently quantify where animals are going and when, and monitor changes in habitat. This is of fundamental importance to management and conservation efforts.},

Open-source oceanographic measurements and outputs from high-resolution models are increasingly available and accessible. Temperature and depth profiles recorded by electronic tags can be integrated with these empirical data and model outputs to construct likelihoods and improve geolocation estimates. The R package {HMMoce} leverages available tag and oceanographic data to improve position estimates derived from electronic tags using a hidden Markov approach. We illustrate the use of the model and test its performance using example blue and mako shark archival tag data. Model results were validated using independent, known tracks and compared to results from other geolocation approaches. {HMMoce} exhibited as much as six-fold improvement in pointwise error as compared to traditional light-level geolocation approaches.

However, the aquatic behavior of most of these species results in a high number of locations with low or unknown accuracy. Argos data are often filtered to reduce the noise produced by these locations, typically by removing data points requiring unrealistic swimming speeds. Unfortunately, this method excludes a considerable number of good?quality locations that have high traveling speeds that are the result of two locations being taken very close in time. We present an alternative algorithm, based on swimming speed, distance between successive locations, and turning angles. This new filter was tested on 67 tracks from nine different marine mammal species: ringed, bearded, gray, harbor, southern elephant, and Antarctic fur seals, walruses, belugas, and narwhals. The algorithm removed similar percentages of low?quality locations (Argos location classes [{LC}] B and A) compared to a filter based solely on swimming speed, but preserved significantly higher percentages of good?quality positions (mean ¬± {SE}\% of locations removed was 4.1 ¬± 0.8\%vs. 12.6 ¬± 1.2\% for {LC} 3; 6.8 ¬± 0.6\%vs. 15.7 ¬± 0.9\% for {LC} 2; and 11.4 ¬± 0.7\%vs. 21.0 ¬± 0.9\% for {LC} 1). The new filter was also more effective at removing unlikely, conspicuous deviations from the track's path, resulting in fewer locations being registered on land and a significant reduction in home range size, when using the Minimum Convex Polygon method, which is sensitive to outliers.},

Achieving the intended conservation benefits will depend, in part, on whether or not the released animals remain at the new human-selected location. The present study tested the hypothesis that hard-shelled sea turtles along the coast of north-eastern Australia (9‚Äì28¬∞S, 142‚Äì153¬∞E) would not remain at new locations and would attempt to return to their original areas. We used satellite-tracking data gathered previously for different purposes over several years (1996‚Äì2014). Some turtles had been released at their capture sites, inferred to be home areas, while other turtles had been displaced (released away from their inferred home areas) for various reasons. All non-displaced turtles (n = 54) remained at their home areas for the duration of tracking. Among displaced turtles (n = 59), the large majority travelled back to their respective home areas (n = 52) or near home (n = 4). Homing turtles travelled faster and adopted straighter routes in cooler water and travelled faster by day than by night. Our results showed that displacement up to 117.4 km and captivity up to 514 days did not disrupt homing ability nor diminish fidelity to the home area. However, for homing turtles we infer energetic costs and heightened risk in unfamiliar coastal waters. Confirmed homing suggests that moving individuals away from danger might offer short-term benefit (e.g. rescue from an oil spill), but moving turtles to a new foraging area is unlikely to succeed as a long-term conservation strategy. Priority must rather be placed on protecting their original habitat.},

During this aggregation period, biologists in aircraft search the caribou summer range trying to detect signals emitted by radio-collared animals and to locate the groups. Unfortunately, some radio-collared animals and their associated groups are missed. The groups that are found are photographed and enumerated, but the total number of photographed caribou underestimates the herd population since groups having no collared animals and some groups with collared animals are missed. This paper proposes a stochastic model to correct the abundance estimator for group undercoverage. An estimator for the size of the population is proposed with an associated variance estimate.

Most of the 19 experimental feeding events that occurred during the 51 dives recorded resulted in specific acceleration patterns that were clearly distinguishable from swimming accelerations. The differential acceleration between the head-mounted and jaw-mounted accelerometers detected 84\% of prey captures on the vertical axis and 89\% on the horizontal axis. However, the jaw-mounted accelerometer alone proved to be equally effective at detecting prey capture attempts. Acceleration along the horizontal (surge)-axis appeared to be particularly efficient in detecting prey captures, and suggests that a single accelerometer placed under the jaw of a pinniped is a promising and easily implemented means of recording prey capture attempts.},

	abstract = {Understanding the diving behaviour of diving predators in relation to concomitant prey distribution could have major practical applications in conservation biology by allowing the assessment of how changes in fine scale prey distribution impact foraging efficiency and ultimately population dynamics. The southern elephant seal (Mirounga leonina, hereafter {SES}), the largest phocid, is a major predator of the southern ocean feeding on myctophids and cephalopods. Because of its large size it can carry bio-loggers with minimal disturbance. Moreover, it has great diving abilities and a wide foraging habitat. Thus, the {SES} is a well suited model species to study predator diving behaviour and the distribution of ecologically important prey species in the Southern Ocean. In this study, we examined how {SESs} adjust their diving behaviour and horizontal movements in response to fine scale prey encounter densities using high resolution accelerometers, magnetometers, pressure sensors and {GPS} loggers. When high prey encounter rates were encountered, animals responded by (1) diving and returning to the surface with steeper angles, reducing the duration of transit dive phases (thus improving dive efficiency), and (2) exhibiting more horizontally and vertically sinuous bottom phases. In these cases, the distance travelled horizontally at the surface was reduced. This behaviour is likely to counteract horizontal displacement from water currents, as they try to remain within favourable prey patches. The prey encounter rate at the bottom of dives decreased with increasing diving depth, suggesting a combined effect of decreased accessibility and prey density with increasing depth. Prey encounter rate also decreased when the bottom phases of dives were spread across larger vertical extents of the water column. This result suggests that the vertical aggregation of prey can regulate prey density, and as a consequence impact the foraging success of {SESs}. To our knowledge, this is one of only a handful of studies showing how the vertical distributions and structure of prey fields influence the prey encounter rates of a diving predator.},

	abstract = {Moving object data handling has received a fair share of attention over recent years in the spatial database community. This is understandable as positioning technology is rapidly making its way into the consumer market, not only through the already ubiquitous cell phone but soon also through small, on-board positioning devices in many means of transport and in other types of portable equipment. It is thus to be expected that all these devices will start to generate an unprecedented data stream of time-stamped positions. Sooner or later, such enormous volumes of data will lead to storage, transmission, computation, and display challenges. Hence, the need for compression techniques.Although previously some work has been done in compression for time series data, this work mainly deals with one-dimensional time series. On the other hand, they are good for short time series and in absence of noise, two characteristics not met by moving objects.We target applications in which present and past positions of objects are important, so focus on the compression of moving object trajectories. The paper applies some older techniques of line generalization, and compares their performance against algorithms that we specifically designed for compressing moving object trajectories.},

To make the {BM} approach computationally feasible for high-dimensional (big) data, we exploit the properties of the processes along with approximations to the likelihood to break the high-dimensional problem into a series of lower dimensional problems. To implement the alternative, downscaling approach, we use R-{INLA} to connect the two sources of observations via a linear mixed effect model. We compare the predictions of the two approaches by cross-validation as well as simulations. Our results show that both approaches yield similar results‚Äîboth provide accurate, high resolution estimates of the at-sea locations of the northern fur seals, as well as Bayesian credible intervals to characterize the uncertainty about the estimated movement paths.},

Food-chain length is predicted to be shorter in ecosystems subjected to greater disturbance because longer chains are theoretically less resilient to perturbation. Moreover, food-chain length is expected to be longer in larger ecosystems because increasing ecosystem size increases species richness and stabilizes predator‚Äìprey interactions, or increases total resource availability. Here we test the roles of disturbance and ecosystem size in determining the food-chain length of terrestrial food webs on Bahamian islands. We found that disturbance affected the identity of top predators, but did not change food-chain length because alternative top predators occupied similar trophic positions. On the other hand, a 106- fold increase in ecosystem size elevated food-chain length by one trophic level. We suggest that the effect of disturbance on food-chain length is weak when alternate top predators are trophic omnivores and have similar trophic positions. This and previous work in lakes suggest that ecosystem size may be a strong determinant of food-chain length in both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems.},

	abstract = {The growing capacity to process and store animal tracks has spurred the development of new methods to segment animal trajectories into elementary units of movement. Key challenges for movement trajectory segmentation are to (i) minimize the need of supervision, (ii) reduce computational costs, (iii) minimize the need of prior assumptions (e.g. simple parametrizations), and (iv) capture biologically meaningful semantics, useful across a broad range of species. We introduce the Expectation-Maximization binary Clustering ({EMbC}), a general purpose, unsupervised approach to multivariate data clustering. The {EMbC} is a variant of the Expectation-Maximization Clustering ({EMC}), a clustering algorithm based on the maximum likelihood estimation of a Gaussian mixture model. This is an iterative algorithm with a closed form step solution and hence a reasonable computational cost. The method looks for a good compromise between statistical soundness and ease and generality of use (by minimizing prior assumptions and favouring the semantic interpretation of the final clustering). Here we focus on the suitability of the {EMbC} algorithm for behavioural annotation of movement data. We show and discuss the {EMbC} outputs in both simulated trajectories and empirical movement trajectories including different species and different tracking methodologies. We use synthetic trajectories to assess the performance of {EMbC} compared to classic {EMC} and Hidden Markov Models. Empirical trajectories allow us to explore the robustness of the {EMbC} to data loss and data inaccuracies, and assess the relationship between {EMbC} output and expert label assignments. Additionally, we suggest a smoothing procedure to account for temporal correlations among labels, and a proper visualization of the output for movement trajectories. Our algorithm is available as an R-package with a set of complementary functions to ease the analysis.},

	abstract = {Many animals undertake movements that are longer scaled and more directed than their typical home ranging behaviour. These movements include seasonal migrations (e.g. between breeding and feeding grounds), natal dispersal, nomadic range shifts and responses to local environmental disruptions. While various heuristic tools exist for identifying range shifts and migrations, none explicitly model the movement of the animals within a statistical framework that facilitates quantitative comparisons. We present the mechanistic range shift analysis ({MRSA}), a method to estimate a suite of range shift parameters: times of initiation, duration of transitions, centroids and areas of respective ranges. The method can take the autocorrelation and irregular sampling that is characteristic of much movement data into account. The mechanistic parameters suggest an intuitive measure, the range shift index, for the extent of a range shift. The likelihood based estimation further allows for statistical tests of several relevant hypotheses, including a range shift test, a stopover test and a site fidelity test. The analysis tools are provided in an R package (marcher). We applied the {MRSA} to a population of {GPS} tracked roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) in the Italian Alps between 2005 and 2008. With respect to seasonal migration, this population is extremely variable and difficult to classify. Using the {MRSA}, we were able to quantify the behaviours across the population and among individuals across years, identifying extents, durations and locations of seasonal range shifts, including cases that would have been ambiguous to detect using existing tools. The strongest patterns were differences across years: many animals simply did not perform a seasonal migration to wintering grounds during the mild winter of 2006‚Äì2007, even though some of these same animals did move extensively in other, harsher winters. For seasonal migrants, however, site fidelity across years was extremely high, even after skipping an entire seasonal migration. These results suggest that for roe deer behavioural plasticity and tactical responses to immediate environmental cues are reflected in the decision of whether rather than where to migrate. The {MRSA} also revealed a trade-off between the probability of migrating and the size of a home range.},

Recent studies have applied a model-driven approach to classifying and quantifying animal movement from global positioning system ({GPS}) location data. We improve upon these methods by 1) revising model structure to provide a simple biologically-defensible basis to reduce misclassification; 2) introducing a data-efficient tool that can be used to quantify and circumvent model sensitivity to starting location; and 3) illustrating how existing models can be adapted to describe short-distance migration, using elevational migration as an example. These improve- ments are included in ‚Äò{migrateR}', an open source R package that expands and automates model-driven classification and quantification of animal movement behavior. We demonstrate the software and these improved methods using {GPS}-collar location data from a long-distance migrant, elk Cervus elaphus, and a short-distance elevational migrant, Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep Ovis canadensis sierrae.

	abstract = {When data streams are observed without error and at regular time intervals, discrete-time hidden Markov models ({HMMs}) have become immensely popular for the analysis of animal location and auxiliary biotelemetry data. However, measurement error and temporally irregular data are often pervasive in telemetry studies, particularly in marine systems. While relatively small amounts of missing data that are missing-completely-at-random are not typically problematic in {HMMs}, temporal irregularity can result in few (if any) observations aligning with the regular time steps required by {HMMs}. Fitting {HMMs} that explicitly account for uncertainty attributable to location measurement error, temporally irregular observations, or other forms of missing data typically requires computationally demanding techniques, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC}). Using simulation and a real-world bearded seal (Erignathus barbatus) example, I investigate a practical alternative to incorporating measurement error and temporally irregular observations into {HMMs} based on multiple imputation of the position process drawn from a single-state continuous-time movement model. This two-stage approach is relatively simple, performed with existing software using efficient maximum likelihood methods, and completely parallelizable. I generally found the approach to perform well across a broad range of simulated measurement error and irregular sampling rates, with latent states and locations reliably recovered in nearly all simulated scenarios. However, high measurement error coupled with low sampling rates often induced bias in both the estimated probability distributions of data streams derived from the imputed position process and the estimated effects of spatial covariates on state transition probabilities. Results from the two-stage analysis of the bearded seal data were similar to a more computationally intensive single-stage {MCMC} analysis, but the two-stage analysis required much less computation time and no custom model-fitting algorithms. I thus found the two-stage multiple-imputation approach to be promising in terms of its ease of implementation, computation time, and performance. Code for implementing the approach using the R package ‚Äú{momentuHMM}‚Äù is provided.Supplementary materials accompanying this paper appear online.},

	abstract = {Background Although habitat use reflects a dynamic process, most studies assess habitat use statically as if an animal's successively recorded locations reflected a point rather than a movement process. By relying on the activity time between successive locations instead of the local density of individual locations, movement-based methods can substantially improve the biological relevance of utilization distribution ({UD}) estimates (i.e. the relative frequencies with which an animal uses the various areas of its home range, {HR}). One such method rests on Brownian bridges ({BBs}). Its theoretical foundation (purely and constantly diffusive movements) is paradoxically inconsistent with both {HR} settlement and habitat selection. An alternative involves movement-based kernel density estimation ({MKDE}) through location interpolation, which may be applied to various movement behaviours but lacks a sound theoretical basis. Methodology/Principal Findings I introduce the concept of a biased random (advective-diffusive) bridge ({BRB}) and show that the {MKDE} method is a practical means to estimate {UDs} based on simplified (isotropically diffusive) {BRBs}. The equation governing {BRBs} is constrained by the maximum delay between successive relocations warranting constant within-bridge advection (allowed to vary between bridges) but remains otherwise similar to the {BB} equation. Despite its theoretical inconsistencies, the {BB} method can therefore be applied to animals that regularly reorientate within their {HRs} and adapt their movements to the habitats crossed, provided that they were relocated with a high enough frequency. Conclusions/Significance Biased random walks can approximate various movement types at short times from a given relocation. Their simplified form constitutes an effective trade-off between too simple, unrealistic movement models, such as Brownian motion, and more sophisticated and realistic ones, such as biased correlated random walks ({BCRWs}), which are too complex to yield functional bridges. Relying on simplified {BRBs} proves to be the most reliable and easily usable way to estimate {UDs} from serially correlated relocations and raw activity information.},

Accurate quantification of the utilization distribution is important for identifying the way animals use the landscape. 3. We improve the {BBMM} by allowing for changes in behaviour, using likelihood statistics to determine change points along the animal's movement path. 4. This novel extension, outperforms the current {BBMM} as indicated by simulations and examples of a territorial mammal and a migratory bird. The unique ability of our model to work with tracks that are not sampled regularly is especially important for {GPS} tags that have frequent failed fixes or dynamic sampling schedules.

Relocation data often represent a complex mixture of different movement behaviors, and reliably decomposing this mix into its component parts is an unresolved problem in movement ecology. Traditional approaches, such as composite random walk models, require that the timescales characterizing the movement are all similar to the usually arbitrary data-sampling rate. Movement behaviors such as long-distance searching and fine-scale foraging, however, are often intermixed but operate on vastly different spatial and temporal scales. An approach that integrates the full sweep of movement behaviors across scales is currently lacking.

The {LSP} accommodates missing observations and variation in the sampling intervals of the location time series. We describe a new, fast algorithm to compute the {LSP}. The gain in speed compared to other R implementations of the {LSP} makes it tractable to analyze long datasets ({\textbackslash}textgreater106 records). We also give a detailed primer on periodicity analysis, focusing on the specificities of movement data. In particular, we warn against the risk of flawed inference when the sampling schedule creates artefactual periodicities and we introduce a new statistical test of periodicity that accommodates temporally autocorrelated background noise. Applying our {LSP}-based analytical protocol to tracking data from three species revealed that an ungulate exhibited periodicity in its movement speed but not in its locations, that a central place-foraging seabird tracked moon phase, and that the movements of a range-resident canid included a daily patrolling component that was initially masked by the stochasticity of the movements. The new, fast algorithm tailored for movement data analysis and now available in the R-package ctmm makes the {LSP} a convenient exploratory tool to detect periodic patterns in animal movement data.},

In this paper, we start from the observation that existing two-table ordination techniques and related measures of niche breadth inevitably weight a sample in proportion to its abundance. We introduce a new multivariate method, which gives a more even weight to all sampling units, including those which are species poor or individual poor. We use this new method of analysis which we call {OMI} (for Outlying Mean Index) to address the question of niche separation and niche breadth. The Outlying Mean Index, or species marginality, measures the distance between the mean habitat conditions used by species (species centroid), and the mean habitat conditions of the sampling area (origin of the niche hyperspace), and {OMI} analysis places species along habitat conditions using a maximization of their mean {OMI}. Therefore, the position of the species depends on their niche deviation from a reference, which represents neither the mean nor the most abundant species, but a theoretical ubiquitous species that tolerates the most general habitat conditions (i.e., a hypothetical species uniformly distributed among habitat conditions). We demonstrate that {OMI} analysis is well suited for the investigation of multidimensional niche breadths in the case of strong limiting factors (e.g., meteorological conditions) or strong driving forces (e.g., longitudinal stream gradient). Furthermore, the analysis helps in finding which ecological factors are most important for community structure and organization and provides a separation of species based on their niche characteristics.},

This has led to new opportunities and challenges when investigating animal movement behaviour and habitat selection.

There are several aspects of {SSFs} where consensus has not yet been reached such as how to analyse the data, when to consider habitat covariates along linear paths between observations rather than at their endpoints, how many random steps should be considered to measure availability, and how to account for individual variation. In this review we aim to address all these issues, as well as to highlight weak features of this modelling approach that should be developed by further research.

However, differences in spatial and temporal resolution between movement and remote sensing data limit their direct assimilation. In this context, we built a data-driven framework to map resource suitability that addresses these differences as well as the limitations of satellite imagery. It combines seasonal composites of multiyear surface reflectances and optimized presence and absence samples acquired with animal movement data within a cross-validation modeling scheme. Moreover, it responds to dynamic, site-specific environmental conditions making it applicable to contrasting landscapes. We tested this framework using five populations of White Storks (Ciconia ciconia) to model resource suitability related to foraging achieving accuracies from 0.40 to 0.94 for presences and 0.66 to 0.93 for absences. These results were influenced by the temporal composition of the seasonal reflectances indicated by the lower accuracies associated with higher day differences in relation to the target dates. Additionally, population differences in resource selection influenced our results marked by the negative relationship between the model accuracies and the variability of the surface reflectances associated with the presence samples. Our modeling approach spatially splits presences between training and validation. As a result, when these represent different and unique resources, we face a negative bias during validation. Despite these inaccuracies, our framework offers an important basis to analyze species‚Äìenvironment interactions. As it standardizes site-dependent behavioral and environmental characteristics, it can be used in the comparison of intra- and interspecies environmental requirements and improves the analysis of resource selection along migratory paths. Moreover, due to its sensitivity to differences in resource selection, our approach can contribute toward a better understanding of species requirements.},

For data that involve a regular sampling unit and negligible measurement error, these models usually are sufficiently flexible to capture the complex correlation structure found in movement data, yet are computationally inexpensive compared to alternative methods. The R package {moveHMM} allows ecologists to process {GPS} tracking data into series of step lengths and turning angles, and to fit an {HMM} to these data, allowing, in particular, for the incorporation of environmental covariates. The package includes assessment and visualization tools for the fitted model. We illustrate the use of {moveHMM} using (simulated) movement of the legendary wild haggis Haggis scoticus.

	abstract = {Abstract The flight performance of birds is strongly affected by the dynamic state of the atmosphere at the birds' locations. Studies of flight and its impact on the movement ecology of birds must consider the wind to help us understand aerodynamics and bird flight strategies. Here, we introduce a systematic approach to evaluate wind speed and direction from the high?frequency {GPS} recordings from bird?borne tags during thermalling flight. Our method assumes that a fixed horizontal mean wind speed during a short (18seconds, 19 {GPS} fixes) flight segment with a constant turn angle along a closed loop, characteristic of thermalling flight, will generate a fixed drift for each consequent location. We use a maximum?likelihood approach to estimate that drift and to determine the wind and airspeeds at the birds' flight locations. We also provide error estimates for these {GPS}?derived wind speed estimates. We validate our approach by comparing its wind estimates with the mid?resolution weather reanalysis data from {ECMWF}, and by examining independent wind estimates from pairs of birds in a large dataset of {GPS}?tagged migrating storks that were flying in close proximity. Our approach provides accurate and unbiased observations of wind speed and additional detailed information on vertical winds and uplift structure. These precise measurements are otherwise rare and hard to obtain and will broaden our understanding of atmospheric conditions, flight aerodynamics, and bird flight strategies. With an increasing number of {GPS}?tracked animals, we may soon be able to use birds to inform us about the atmosphere they are flying through and thus improve future ecological and environmental studies.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0008677},
	abstract = {Background {ARGOS} satellite telemetry is one of the most widely used methods to track the movements of free-ranging marine and terrestrial animals and is fundamental to studies of foraging ecology, migratory behavior and habitat-use. {ARGOS} location estimates do not include complete error estimations, and for many marine organisms, the most commonly acquired locations (Location Class 0, A, B, or Z) are provided with no declared error estimate. Methodology/Principal Findings We compared the accuracy of {ARGOS} locations to those obtained using Fastloc {GPS} from the same electronic tags on five species of pinnipeds: 9 California sea lions (Zalophus californianus), 4 Galapagos sea lions (Zalophus wollebaeki), 6 Cape fur seals (Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus), 3 Australian fur seals (A. p. doriferus) and 5 northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris). These species encompass a range of marine habitats (highly pelagic vs coastal), diving behaviors (mean dive durations 2‚Äì21 min) and range of latitudes (equator to temperate). A total of 7,318 {ARGOS} positions and 27,046 {GPS} positions were collected. Of these, 1,105 {ARGOS} positions were obtained within five minutes of a {GPS} position and were used for comparison. The 68th percentile {ARGOS} location errors as measured in this study were {LC}-3 0.49 km, {LC}-2 1.01 km, {LC}-1 1.20 km, {LC}-0 4.18 km, {LC}-A 6.19 km, {LC}-B 10.28 km. Conclusions/Significance The {ARGOS} errors measured here are greater than those provided by {ARGOS}, but within the range of other studies. The error was non-normally distributed with each {LC} highly right-skewed. Locations of species that make short duration dives and spend extended periods on the surface (sea lions and fur seals) had less error than species like elephant seals that spend more time underwater and have shorter surface intervals. Supplemental data (S1) are provided allowing the creation of density distributions that can be used in a variety of filtering algorithms to improve the quality of {ARGOS} tracking data.},

To date, there is no standard way of analysing geolocator data, making communication of analyses cumbersome and hampering the reproducibility of results. We have, therefore, developed the R package GeoLight, which provides basic functions for all steps of determining global positioning and a new approach in analysing movement pattern. Here, we briefly introduce and discuss the major functions of this package using example movement data of European hoopoe (Upupa epops).},

An increasing number of studies focus on animals' movement in three dimensions (3D), but the key properties of CRW, such as the way the mean squared displacement is related to the path length, are well known only in 1D and 2D. In this paper I derive such properties for 3D CRW, in a consistent way with the expression of these properties in 2D. This should allow 3D CRW to act as a null model when analyzing actual 3D movements similarly to what is done in 2D},

However, only one of these, dead-reckoning, has the capacity to provide continuous data for animal movements over fine scales. Dead-reckoning has been applied almost exclusively in the study of marine species, in part due to the difficulty of accurately measuring the speed of terrestrial species. In the present study we evaluate the use of accelerometers and a metric known as overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA) as a proxy for the measurement of speed for use in dead-reckoning. Data were collated from previous studies, for 10 species locomoting on a treadmill and their ODBA measured by an attached data logger. All species except one showed a highly significant linear relationship between speed and ODBA; however, there was appreciable inter- and intra-specific variance in this relationship. ODBA was then used to estimate speed in a simple trial run of a dead-reckoning track. Estimating distance travelled using speed derived from prior calibration for ODBA resulted in appreciable errors. We describe a method by which these errors can be minimised, by periodic ground-truthing (e.g., by GPS or VHF telemetry) of the dead-reckoned track and adjusting the relationship between speed and ODBA until actual known positions and dead-reckoned positions accord.},

abstract = {A resource selection function is a model of the likelihood that an available spatial unit will be used by an animal, given its resource value. But how do we appropriately define availability? Step selection analysis deals with this problem at the scale of the observed positional data, by matching each ‚Äòused step‚Äô (connecting two consecutive observed positions of the animal) with a set of ‚Äòavailable steps‚Äô randomly sampled from a distribution of observed steps or their characteristics. Here we present a simple extension to this approach, termed integrated step selection analysis (iSSA), which relaxes the implicit assumption that observed movement attributes (i.e. velocities and their temporal autocorrelations) are independent of resource selection. Instead, iSSA relies on simultaneously estimating movement and resource selection parameters, thus allowing simple likelihood-based inference of resource selection within a mechanistic movement model. We provide theoretical underpinning of iSSA, as well as practical guidelines to its implementation. Using computer simulations, we evaluate the inferential and predictive capacity of iSSA compared to currently used methods. Our work demonstrates the utility of iSSA as a general, flexible and user-friendly approach for both evaluating a variety of ecological hypotheses, and predicting future ecological patterns.},

Thus, this discipline also holds great promise for improving the conservation of wildlife. To measure progress towards this promise, we investigated the degree to which movement ecology research is connected to conservation goals as well as the proportion of studies that were incorporated into federal and international status assessments for mobile species at risk. We examined 13,349 ‚Äúmovement ecology‚Äù papers published between 1990 and 2014 and found that explicit connections to conservation and management were made in 35\% (n = 4, 672) of these papers, with the number of connections increasing over time. We then measured the uptake of movement ecology research into species status assessment and recovery plans (n = 72 documents) produced by three different governance agencies for 12 endangered mobile species. We found that on average 60 \% of available movement ecology research was used in the status assessment process, demonstrating that when movement ecology research is available, it is generally being utilized in conservation planning. However, for 25\% of these species, there was little movement research available to be used, highlighting that knowledge gaps remain for some at-risk species despite the general growth of movement ecology research. We outline opportunities for movement ecology to promote more effective conservation of taxa that move.},

	abstract = {The exponential growth of scientific literature ‚Äì which we call the ‚Äòbig literature‚Äô phenomenon ‚Äì has created great challenges in literature comprehension and synthesis. The traditional manual literature synthesis processes are often unable to take advantage of big literature due to human limitations in time and cognition, creating the need for new literature synthesis methods to address this challenge. In this paper, we discuss a highly useful literature synthesis approach, automated content analysis (ACA), which has not yet been widely adopted in the fields of ecology and evolutionary biology. ACA is a suite of machine learning tools for the qualitative and quantitative synthesis of big literature commonly used in the social sciences and in medical research. Our goal is to introduce ecologists and evolutionary biologists to ACA and illustrate its capacity to synthesize overwhelming volumes of literature. First, we provide a brief history of the ACA method and summarize the fundamental process of ACA. Next, we present two ACA studies to illustrate the utility and versatility of ACA in synthesizing ecological and evolutionary literature. Finally, we discuss how to maximize the utility and contributions of ACA, as well as potential research directions that may help to advance the use of ACA in future ecological and evolutionary research. Unlike manual methods of literature synthesis, ACA is able to process high volumes of literature at substantially shorter time spans, while helping to mitigate human biases. The overall efficiency and versatility of this method allow for a broad range of applications for literature review and synthesis, including both exploratory reviews and systematic reviews aiming to address more targeted research questions. By allowing for more extensive and comprehensive reviews of big literature, ACA has the potential to fill an important methodological gap and therefore contribute to the advancement of ecological and evolutionary research.},

Here, we fill this gap by reviewing how to optimize the use of biologging techniques to answer questions in movement ecology and synthesize this into an Integrated Biologging Framework (IBF). We highlight that multisensor approaches are a new frontier in biologging, while identifying current limitations and avenues for future development in sensor technology. We focus on the importance of efficient data exploration, and more advanced multidimensional visualization methods, combined with appropriate archiving and sharing approaches, to tackle the big data issues presented by biologging. We also discuss the challenges and opportunities in matching the peculiarities of specific sensor data to the statistical models used, highlighting at the same time the large advances which will be required in the latter to properly analyse biologging data. Taking advantage of the biologging revolution will require a large improvement in the theoretical and mathematical foundations of movement ecology, to include the rich set of high-frequency multivariate data, which greatly expand the fundamentally limited and coarse data that could be collected using location-only technology such as GPS. Equally important will be the establishment of multidisciplinary collaborations to catalyse the opportunities offered by current and future biologging technology. If this is achieved, clear potential exists for developing a vastly improved mechanistic understanding of animal movements and their roles in ecological processes and for building realistic predictive models.},

	abstract = {A common challenge in species conservation and management is how to incorporate species movements into management objectives. There often is a lack of knowledge of where, when and why species move. The field of movement ecology has grown rapidly in the last decade and is now providing the knowledge needed to incorporate movements of species into management planning. This knowledge can also be used to develop management strategies that are flexible in time and space and may improve the effectiveness of management actions. Therefore, wildlife management and conservation may benefit by strengthening the link with movement ecology. We present a framework that illustrates how animal movement can be used to enhance conservation planning and identify management actions that are complementary to existing strategies. The framework contains five steps that identify (1) the movement attributes of a species, (2) their impacts on ecosystems, (3) how this knowledge can be used to guide the scale and type of management, (4) the implementation, and (5) the evaluation of management actions. We discuss these five steps in detail, highlighting why the step is important and how the information can be obtained. We illustrate the framework through a case study of managing a highly mobile species, the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), a harvested species of conservation concern. We believe that the movement-management framework provides an important, and timely, link between movement ecology and wildlife management and conservation, and highlights the potential for complementary, dynamic solutions for managing wildlife.},

	abstract = {The dynamic nature of most environments forces many animals to move to meet their fundamental needs. This is especially true in aquatic environments where shifts in spatial ecology (which are a result of movements) are among the first adaptive responses of animals to changes in ecosystems. Changes in the movement and distribution of individuals will in turn alter population dynamics and ecosystem structure. Thus, understanding the drivers and impacts of variation in animal movements over time is critical to conservation and spatial planning. Here we identify key challenges that impede aquatic animal movement science from informing management and conservation, and propose strategies for overcoming them. Challenges include: 1) Insufficient communication between terrestrial and aquatic movement scientists that could be increased through cross-pollination of analytical tools and development of new tools and outputs; 2) Incomplete coverage in many studies of animal space use (e.g. entire life span not considered); 3) Insufficient data archiving and availability; 4) Barriers to incorporating movement data into decision-making processes; and 5) Limited understanding of the value of movement data for management and conservation. We argue that the field of movement ecology is at present an under-tapped resource for aquatic decision-makers, but is poised to play a critical role in future management approaches and policy development.},

	abstract = {Animal telemetry is a powerful tool for observing marine animals and the physical environments that they inhabit, from coastal and continental shelf ecosystems to polar seas and open oceans. Satellite-linked biologgers and networks of acoustic receivers allow animals to be reliably monitored over scales of tens of meters to thousands of kilometres, giving insight into their habitat use, home range size, the phenology of migratory patterns and the biotic and abiotic factors that drive their distributions. Furthermore, physical environmental variables can be collected using animals as autonomous sampling platforms, increasing spatial and temporal coverage of global oceanographic observation systems. The use of animal telemetry therefore has the capacity to provide measures from a suite of essential ocean variables (EOVs) for improved monitoring of Earth‚Äôs oceans. Here we outline the design features of animal telemetry systems, describe current applications and their benefits and challenges, and discuss future directions. We describe new analytical techniques that improve our ability to not only quantify animal movements but to also provide a powerful framework for comparative studies across taxa. We discuss the application of animal telemetry and its capacity to collect biotic and abiotic data, how the data collected can be incorporated into ocean observing systems, and the role these data can play in improved ocean management.},

These technologies have the potential to revolutionize ecology by providing ?next?generation? ecological data, particularly when integrated with each other, and in doing so could be applied to address a diverse range of requirements (e.g., pest and wildlife management, informing environmental policy and decision making). Critical to technoecology's rate of advancement and uptake by ecologists and environmental managers will be fostering increased interdisciplinary collaboration. Ideally, such partnerships will span the conception, implementation, and enhancement phases of ideas, bridging the university, public, and private sectors.},

	abstract = {The programming language R is widely used in many fields. We explored the extent of reported R use in the field of ecology using the Web of Science and text mining. We analyzed the frequencies of R packages reported in more than 60,000 peer-reviewed articles published in 30 ecology journals during a 10-yr period ending in 2017. The number of studies reported using R as their primary tool in data analysis increased linearly from 11.4\% in 2008 to 58.0\% in 2017. The top 10 packages reported were lme4, vegan, nlme, ape, MuMIn, MASS, mgcv, ade4, multcomp, and car. The increasing popularity of R has most likely furthered open science in ecological research because it can improve reproducibility of analyses and captures workflows when scripts and codes are included and shared. These findings may not be entirely unique to R because there are other programming languages used by ecologists, but they do strongly suggest that given the relatively high frequency of reported use of R, it is a significant component of contemporary analytics in the field of ecology.},

	abstract = {With the influx of complex and detailed tracking data gathered from electronic tracking devices, the analysis of animal movement data has recently emerged as a cottage industry among biostatisticians. New approaches of ever greater complexity are continue to be added to the literature. In this paper, we review what we believe to be some of the most popular and most useful classes of statistical models used to analyse individual animal movement data. Specifically, we consider discrete-time hidden Markov models, more general state-space models and diffusion processes. We argue that these models should be core components in the toolbox for quantitative researchers working on stochastic modelling of individual animal movement. The paper concludes by offering some general observations on the direction of statistical analysis of animal movement. There is a trend in movement ecology towards what are arguably overly complex modelling approaches which are inaccessible to ecologists, unwieldy with large data sets or not based on mainstream statistical practice. Additionally, some analysis methods developed within the ecological community ignore fundamental properties of movement data, potentially leading to misleading conclusions about animal movement. Corresponding approaches, e.g. based on L\{√©\}vy walk-type models, continue to be popular despite having been largely discredited. We contend that there is a need for an appropriate balance between the extremes of either being overly complex or being overly simplistic, whereby the discipline relies on models of intermediate complexity that are usable by general ecologists, but grounded in well-developed statistical practice and efficient to fit to large data sets.},

Using the movement ecology framework, we review animal movement in production landscapes, including areas managed for agriculture and forestry. We consider internal and external drivers of altered animal movement and how this affects navigation and motion capacities and population dynamics. Conventional management approaches in fragmented landscapes focus on promoting connectivity using structural changes in the landscape. However, a movement ecology perspective emphasizes that manipulating the internal motivations or navigation capacity of animals represents untapped opportunities to improve movement and the effectiveness of structural connectivity investments. Integrating movement and landscape ecology opens new opportunities for conservation management in production landscapes.},

Yet, a lack of understanding about how different organisms move in relation to landscape structure and resource availability may prevent full understanding of species declines and extinctions. In this perspective, we introduce the concept of movement ecology for aquatic-breeding amphibians, summarize our knowledge on amphibian movement, identify critical gaps, and provide a context for how understanding movement will help develop solutions for more effective amphibian conservation. Juvenile amphibian movement is a multi-phase process during which individuals adjust movement speed, responsiveness to habitat features, and propensity of settling based on internal state and the external environment. Our review enables future studies to place amphibian movement data into a larger explanatory context and could help guide new avenues of research. Understanding juvenile responses to habitat features during dispersal will aid in developing realistic, predictive models of amphibian movement that could be used to further conservation and management efforts such as mitigation and restoration, and will also add to theory about how movement mechanisms during dispersal impact population persistence in altered landscapes.},

	abstract = {Studies about the movement of mammals have recently gained much emphasis thanks to the development of new tracking technology, allowing highly accurate recording of animal movement. However, the amount of data made available requires effective theoretical and analytical framework for appropriate scientific use, i.e. to answer questions of interest. Within this review, we used systematic reviewing technique and the movement ecology framework to assess current knowledge and gaps in wild boar Sus scrofa spatial behaviour, species of high economic, ecological and social interest. Specifically, we observed that the development of new tracking techniques (radio-telemetry and global positioning system) has promoted movement-related studies since the early 2000. However, the ecology of movement, i.e. the why, how, when and where exactly an individual is moving is rarely the focus of these studies, which instead lies in the consequences of wild boar movement, e.g. the spread of disease, seed dispersal or damage. Most of the current studies are thus concerned with the interaction between environmental factors and spatial behaviour of the species, while other components of movement, internal state, navigation, and motion capacity are seldom studied. Compared to others ungulates, we also observed that wild boar movement ecology is still poorly considered in the literature. This review highlights the need for more quantitative descriptions of movement and behavioural-based approaches relating wild boar movement to its internal, navigational, and motion capacities. We expect that facilitated access to tracking technologies, in terms of cost and miniaturization, along with current interest in movement ecology will greatly promote increased knowledge in wild boar spatial behaviour.},

Here we examine the effectiveness of four approaches to data archiving: no stated archiving policy, recommending (but not requiring) archiving, and two versions of mandating data deposition at acceptance. We control for differences between data types by trying to obtain data from papers that use a single, widespread population genetic analysis, structure. At one extreme, we found that mandated data archiving policies that require the inclusion of a data availability statement in the manuscript improve the odds of finding the data online almost 1000-fold compared to having no policy. However, archiving rates at journals with less stringent policies were only very slightly higher than those with no policy at all. We also assessed the effectiveness of asking for data directly from authors and obtained over half of the requested datasets, albeit with ‚àº8 d delay and some disagreement with authors. Given the long-term benefits of data accessibility to the academic community, we believe that journal-based mandatory data archiving policies and mandatory data availability statements should be more widely adopted.‚ÄîVines, T.

	abstract = {In the past decade, ecologists have witnessed vast improvements in our ability to collect animal movement data through animal-borne technology, such as through GPS or ARGOS systems. However, more data does not necessarily yield greater knowledge in understanding animal ecology and conservation. In this paper, we provide a review of the major benefits, problems and potential misuses of GPS/Argos technology to animal ecology and conservation. Benefits are obvious, and include the ability to collect fine-scale spatio-temporal location data on many previously impossible to study animals, such as ocean-going fish, migratory songbirds and long-distance migratory mammals. These benefits come with significant problems, however, imposed by frequent collar failures and high cost, which often results in weaker study design, reduced sample sizes and poorer statistical inference. In addition, we see the divorcing of biologists from a field-based understanding of animal ecology to be a growing problem. Despite these difficulties, GPS devices have provided significant benefits, particularly in the conservation and ecology of wide-ranging species. We conclude by offering suggestions for ecologists on which kinds of ecological questions would currently benefit the most from GPS/Argos technology, and where the technology has been potentially misused. Significant conceptual challenges remain, however, including the links between movement and behaviour, and movement and population dynamics.},

While field observations of songbird flocks wheeling in the sky or anchovy schools fleeing from predators have inspired considerable interest in the mechanics of collective motion, the challenge of simultaneously monitoring multiple animals in the field has historically limited our capacity to study collective behaviour of wild animal groups with precision. However, recent technological advancements now present exciting opportunities to overcome many of these limitations. Here we review existing methods used to collect data on the movements and interactions of multiple animals in a natural setting. We then survey emerging technologies that are poised to revolutionize the study of collective animal behaviour by extending the spatial and temporal scales of inquiry, increasing data volume and quality, and expediting the post-processing of raw data.This article is part of the theme issue ‚ÄòCollective movement ecology‚Äô.},

abstract = {Since the 1990s, massive use of drifting Fish Aggregating Devices (dFADs) to aggregate tropical tunas has strongly modified global purse-seine fisheries. For the first time, a large data set of GPS positions from buoys deployed by French purse-seiners to monitor dFADs is analysed to provide information on spatio-temporal patterns of dFAD use in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans during 2007-2011. First, we select among four classification methods the model that best separates "at sea" from "on board" buoy positions. A random forest model had the best performance, both in terms of the rate of false "at sea" predictions and the amount of over-segmentation of "at sea" trajectories (i.e., artificial division of trajectories into multiple, shorter pieces due to misclassification). Performance is improved via post-processing removing unrealistically short "at sea" trajectories. Results derived from the selected model enable us to identify the main areas and seasons of dFAD deployment and the spatial extent of their drift. We find that dFADs drift at sea on average for 39.5 days, with time at sea being shorter and distance travelled longer in the Indian than in the Atlantic Ocean. 9.9\% of all trajectories end with a beaching event, suggesting that 1,500-2,000 may be lost onshore each year, potentially impacting sensitive habitat areas, such as the coral reefs of the Maldives, the Chagos Archipelago, and the Seychelles.},

abstract = {How organisms move and disperse is crucial to understand how population dynamics relates to the spatial heterogeneity of the environment. Random walk (RW) models are typical tools to describe movement patterns. Whether L√©vy or alternative RW better describes forager movements is keenly debated. We get around this issue using the Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD). GPD includes as specific cases Normal, exponential and power law distributions, which underlie Brownian, Poisson-like and L√©vy walks respectively. Whereas previous studies typically confronted a limited set of candidate models, GPD lets the most likely RW model emerge from the data. We illustrate the wide applicability of the method using GPS-tracked seabird foraging movements and fishing vessel movements tracked by Vessel Monitoring System (VMS), both collected in the Peruvian pelagic ecosystem. The two parameters from the fitted GPD, a scale and a shape parameter, provide a synoptic characterization of the observed movement in terms of characteristic scale and diffusive property. They reveal and quantify the variability, among species and individuals, of the spatial strategies selected by predators foraging on a common prey field. The GPD parameters constitute relevant metrics for (1) providing a synthetic and pattern-oriented description of movement, (2) using top predators as ecosystem indicators and (3) studying the variability of spatial behaviour among species or among individuals with different personalities.},

The available theory describes the latter with simple distance-dependent functions that depend on landscape properties such as interpatch distance or patch size. Despite its potential role, we lack a good mechanistic understanding of how the movement of individuals between patches affects the dynamics of these populations. We used the theoretical framework provided by movement ecology to make a direct representation of the processes determining how individuals connect local populations in a spatially structured population of Iberian lynx. Interpatch processes depended on the heterogeneity of the matrix where patches are embedded and the parameters defining individual movement behavior. They were also very sensitive to the dynamic demographic variables limiting the time moving, the within-patch dynamics of available settlement sites (both spatiotemporally heterogeneous) and the response of individuals to the perceived risk while moving. These context-dependent dynamic factors are an inherent part of the movement process, producing connectivities and dispersal kernels whose variability is affected by other demographic processes. Mechanistic representations of interpatch movements, such as the one provided by the movement-ecology framework, permit the dynamic interaction of birth‚Äìdeath processes and individual movement behavior, thus improving our understanding of stochastic spatially structured populations.},

abstract = {1. Understanding the causes and consequences of dispersal remains a central topic in ecology and evolution. However, a mismatch exists between our empirical understanding of the complexity of dispersal and our representation of dispersal in models. While the empirical literature is replete with examples of condition dependence at the emigration, movement and settlement phases, models rarely incorporate realism or complexity to this degree. Nor do models often include the different costs associated with dispersal, which can themselves be linked to one or more of the three key phases. 2. Here, we propose that by explicitly accounting for emigration, movement and settlement (and the multiple costs associated with each) we can substantially improve our understanding of both the dispersal process itself and how dispersal traits trade off against other life-history characteristics. We explore some of these issues conceptually, before presenting illustrative results gained from a flexible individual-based model which incorporates considerable dispersal complexity. 3. These results emphasise the nonlinear interplay between the different dispersal stages. For example, we find that investment in movement ability (at a cost to fecundity) depends upon the propensity to emigrate (and vice versa). However, owing to selection acting at the metapopulation level as well as at the individual level, the relationship between the two is not straightforward. Importantly, the shape of the trade-off between movement ability and reproductive potential can strongly influence the joint evolution of dispersal parameters controlling the degree of investment in safer movement, the probability of emigration and the straightness of movement. 4. Our results highlight that the joint evolution of dispersal characteristics can have major implications for spatial population dynamics and we argue that, in addition to increasing our fundamental biological understanding, a new generation of dispersal modelling, which exploits recent empirical advances, can substantially improve our ability to predict and manage the response of species to environmental change.},

abstract = {Understanding how dispersal movements are motivated and executed is the core business of dispersal evolutionary ecology, which is an active research field in environmental sciences. However, recent advances in dispersal research have not yet been confronted to the movement ecology paradigm (MEP) that was introduced to unify the study of all types of movements of all organisms. Here we aim at doing this exercise to investigate if the MEP is sufficiently general to provide sound predictions on dispersal causes, modalities and consequences. We begin by briefly summarizing the main concepts of the MEP that are relevant to our analysis. A part of some examples, many studies focusing on animal movements share a common, two step procedures: (1) record movement paths, and (2) test post-hoc functional assumptions to identify the relationships between the four basic components listed above. Then we present some important results from dispersal evolutionary ecology research. Next we turn to two groups of model organisms (butterflies and lizards), in which dispersal has been thoroughly studied in the field for decades. These organisms have contrasted dispersal modes: the causes of dispersal are mainly related to the social context in lizards, whereas they are mainly dependent on the environmental context in butterflies. Lizards disperse most often once in their life soon after birth, whereas butterflies generally disperse all over their adult life. We investigate if and how the MEP provides an added value to the study of dispersal on these organisms. Although the MEP is in principle encapsulates almost every variation acting on movement, its ability to incorporate variation in anything else than pure movement trajectories appears to be mixed: dispersal is extremely phenotype- and context-dependent, which rends difficult the use of the MEP as an operational tool to incorporate variation across individuals and situations. We propose that a mixed approach combining the Eulerian and Lagrangian viewpoints could deal with this high dispersal variability. We conclude by providing perspectives for the integration of ecological and evolutionary processes affecting dispersal into the MEP that could increase its efficiency to study dispersal.},

	abstract = {Objective Animal studies have suggested that maternal weight-related factors during pregnancy can program offspring physical activity in a sex-dependent manner. However, there is limited evidence in humans. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between maternal gestational weight gain (GWG) and offspring total physical activity (TPA) level and to determine whether these associations are moderated by sex of offspring or maternal pre-pregnancy weight status. Method We studied 56 boys (mean age = 3.7 years, standard deviation (SD) 0.5) and 57 girls (mean age = 3.5¬±0.5 years) enrolled in licensed childcare centers. TPA was objectively measured using Actical¬Æ accelerometers. Information on pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), GWG, and other maternal factors were collected with a maternal health questionnaire. Associations between GWG, as a continuous variable or categorically (inadequate, adequate, and excessive), and offspring TPA were analysed using linear mixed models to take into account the intraclass correlation between the clusters (childcare centers). Models were adjusted for gestational age, accelerometer weartime, socioeconomic status, and pre-pregnancy BMI status. Results We found a significant sex interaction (P-value = 0.009). In boys, greater GWG was associated with decreased offspring TPA (Œ≤ = -3.2 counts‚ãÖ1000‚àí1/d, 95\% confidence intervals (CI) = -6.4‚Äì0.02, P-value = 0.049). In girls born to mothers categorized as overweight or obese, the association between the GWG and TPA followed an inverted U-shape curve (Œ≤ for GWG squared = -0.1 counts‚ãÖ1000‚àí1/d, 95\% CI = (-0.2 ‚Äì-0.04), P-value = 0.005). In contrast, a U-shaped curve was found in girls born to mothers classified as lean (pre-pregnancy BMI{\textless}25 kg/m2) (Œ≤ for GWG squared = 0.7 counts‚ãÖ1000‚àí1/d, 95\% CI = 0.2‚Äì1.2, P-value = 0.011). In boys, TPA in offspring was higher among women with inadequate GWG compared to adequate GWG (P-value = 0.0137), whereas no significant differences were found in girls (P-value = 0.107). Conclusion Maternal GWG can be an important biological marker of offspring TPA. These findings support the sex-dependent early developmental programming influence of GWG on TPA.},

	abstract = {It is fundamentally important for many animal ecologists to quantify the costs of animal activities, although it is not straightforward to do so. The recording of triaxial acceleration by animal-attached devices has been proposed as a way forward for this, with the specific suggestion that dynamic body acceleration (DBA) be used as a proxy for movement-based power. Dynamic body acceleration has now been validated frequently, both in the laboratory and in the field, although the literature still shows that some aspects of DBA theory and practice are misunderstood. Here, we examine the theory behind DBA and employ modelling approaches to assess factors that affect the link between DBA and energy expenditure, from the deployment of the tag, through to the calibration of DBA with energy use in laboratory and field settings. Using data from a range of species and movement modes, we illustrate that vectorial and additive DBA metrics are proportional to each other. Either can be used as a proxy for energy and summed to estimate total energy expended over a given period, or divided by time to give a proxy for movement-related metabolic power. Nonetheless, we highlight how the ability of DBA to predict metabolic rate declines as the contribution of non-movement-related factors, such as heat production, increases. Overall, DBA seems to be a substantive proxy for movement-based power but consideration of other movement-related metrics, such as the static body acceleration and the rate of change of body pitch and roll, may enable researchers to refine movement-based metabolic costs, particularly in animals where movement is not characterized by marked changes in body acceleration.},

Video filmed by a camera mounted on the head of a Northern Goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) was used to study how the raptor used visual guidance to pursue prey and land on perches. A combination of novel image analysis methods and numerical simulations of mathematical pursuit models was used to determine the goshawk's pursuit strategy. The goshawk flew to intercept targets by fixing the prey at a constant visual angle, using classical pursuit for stationary prey, lures or perches, and usually using constant absolute target direction (CATD) for moving prey. Visual fixation was better maintained along the horizontal than vertical direction. In some cases, we observed oscillations in the visual fix on the prey, suggesting that the goshawk used finite-feedback steering. Video filmed from the ground gave similar results. In most cases, it showed goshawks intercepting prey using a trajectory consistent with CATD, then turning rapidly to attack by classical pursuit; in a few cases, it showed them using curving non-CATD trajectories. Analysis of the prey's evasive tactics indicated that only sharp sideways turns caused the goshawk to lose visual fixation on the prey, supporting a sensory basis for the surprising frequency and effectiveness of this tactic found by previous studies. The dynamics of the prey's looming image also suggested that the goshawk used a tau-based interception strategy. We interpret these results in the context of a concise review of pursuit‚Äìevasion in biology, and conjecture that some prey deimatic ‚Äòstartle‚Äô displays may exploit tau-based interception.},

To realize this concept, ecologists rely on data collection technologies providing spatio-temporal data in order to analyze movement. Recently, wireless sensor networks have offered new opportunities for data collection from remote places through multi-hop communication and collaborative capability of the nodes. Several technologies can be used in such networks for sensing purposes and for collecting spatio-temporal data from animals. In this paper, we investigate and review technological solutions which can be used for collecting data for wildlife monitoring. Our aim is to provide an overview of different sensing technologies used for wildlife monitoring and to review their capabilities in terms of data they provide for modeling movement behavior of animals.},

	abstract = {Interdisciplinarity has become as important outside academia as within. Academics, policy makers, and the general public seek insights to help organize the vast amounts of knowledge being produced, both within research and at all levels of education. The second edition of The Oxford Handbook of Interdisciplinarity offers a thorough update of this major reference work, summarizing the latest advances within the field of inter- and transdisciplinarity. The collection is distinguished by its breadth of coverage, with chapters written by leading experts from multiple networks and organizations. The volume is edited by respected interdisciplinary scholars and supported by a prestigious advisory board to ensure the highest quality and breadth of coverage. The Oxford Handbook of Interdisciplinarity provides a synoptic overview of the current state of interdisciplinary research, education, administration and management, and of problem solving-knowledge that spans the disciplines and interdisciplinary fields. The volume negotiates the space between the academic community and society at large. Offering the most broad-based account of inter- and transdisciplinarity to date, its 47 chapters provide a snapshot of the state of knowledge integration as interdisciplinarity approaches its century mark. This second edition expands its coverage to discuss the emergence of new fields, the increase of interdisciplinary approaches within traditional disciplines and professions, new integrative approaches to education and training, the widening international presence of interdisciplinarity, its increased support in funding agencies and science-policy bodies, and the formation of several new international associations associated with interdisciplinarity. This reference book will be a valuable addition to academic libraries worldwide, important reading for members of the sciences, social sciences, and humanities engaged in interdisciplinary research and education, and helpful for administrators and policy makers seeking to improve the use of knowledge in society.},

	abstract = {Unity between human and physical geography continues to be debated widely. However, if geography is to take advantage of its unique positioning between the natural and social sciences, geographers need to be able to communicate more effectively and efficiently across human and physical specialisms. In this paper we focus on the significance and uses of language in interdisciplinary research practice. Interdisciplinary research faces a range of challenges in achieving effective communication between discipline-based experts, of which language is key. This paper draws on a discussion developing the initial ideas for a research application and a field day to familiarize the group members with the study area. Dialects, metaphor and articulation are identified as three overlapping aspects of language which play an important role in developing understandings between different disciplines. These three different aspects of language are illustrated through the analysis of three situations focusing on the words dynamic, mapping and catchment. We conclude that interdisciplinary projects must allocate time to the development of shared vocabularies and understandings. Common understanding derived from shared languages in turn plays a vital role in enhancing the relations of trust that are necessary for effective interdisciplinary working.},

The UK's Rural Economy and Land Use (RELU) Programme aims to advance understanding of the challenges faced by rural areas through funding interdisciplinary research to inform future policy and practice on management choices for the countryside and rural economies. Addressing the challenges faced by rural areas often requires a combination of different perspectives, involving research to address subjects that may lie beyond the skills of individual researchers. An interdisciplinary approach requires the integration of both data/information and the experiences and perspectives of different people (natural/social scientists, local people and policy-makers). We focus here on the processes involved in making interdisciplinarity work, documenting the experiences, perceptions, ideas and concerns of researchers working in interdisciplinary projects (specifically two EU-funded projects but also the first wave of RELU projects). A key finding from this research is that interdisciplinarity requires conscious effort, time and resources for the development of interpersonal relationships to enhance effective communication and thus successful collaboration.},
