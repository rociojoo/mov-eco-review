This repository is a companion to the manuscript "Recent trends in Movement Ecology: a quantitative review of tools, topics and research gaps", from Rocío Joo, Simona Picardi, Matthew E. Boone, Thomas A. Clay, Samantha C. Patrick, Vilma Romero-Romero and Mathieu Basille. Pre-print available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.00110

  - It also hosts the website dedicated to the paper,
    <https://rociojoo.github.io/mov-eco-review>.
  - It contains the [codes](./R/) to do the analyses of the paper. The data
    processing and analysis are explained on the website.
  - It also contains a [dataset of movement ecology
    papers](./Data/cleaned_papers_all_years_simple.csv) obtained after
    pre-processing the query results from Web of Science and applying the
    cleaning procedure. For each movement ecology paper, the dataset contains
    information of: author, title, journal, keywords, extra.keywords, abstract,
    publisher, publication date, doi, affiliations, and an alternative
    identifier used for the analyses.
