The R codes for the analyses are available in this GitHub repository. A version of this manuscript is available as an arXiv pre-print. 1.1 Abstract of the manuscript Movement is fundamental to life, shaping population dynamics, biodiversity patterns and ecosystem structure. In 2008, the Movement Ecology Framework (MEF; Nathan et al. 2008) introduced an integrative theory of organism movement—linking internal state, motion capacity, and navigation capacity to external factors—which has been recognized as a milestone in the field. Since then, the study of movement experienced a technological boom, which provided massive quantities of tracking data of both animal and human movement globally and at ever finer spatio-temporal resolutions. In this work, we provide a quantitative assessment of the state of research within the MEF, focusing on animal movement, including humans and invertebrates, and excluding movement of plants and microorganisms. Using a text mining approach, we digitally scanned the content of &gt;8000 papers from 2009-2018 available online, identified tools and methods, and assessed all components of the MEF. Over the past decade, the publication rate has increased considerably, along with major technological changes, such as an increased use of GPS devices and accelerometers and a majority of studies now using the R software environment for statistical computing. However, animal movement research still largely focuses on the effect of environmental factors on movement, with much less focus on motion and navigation. We discuss the potential for technological and methodological advances in the field to lead to more integrated and interdisciplinary research and increased exploration of key movement processes like navigation and the evolutionary, physiological, and life-history consequences of movement.

Workflow to identify movement ecology papers. 2.1.1 What is a movement ecology paper? We defined mov-eco papers as scientific peer-reviewed papers that studied the voluntary movement of one or more living individuals. This included humans. 2.1.2 Search keywords We used Web of Science (WoS) as a search engine for the papers. We defined mov-eco papers as scientific peer-reviewed papers that studied the voluntary movement of one or more living individuals. This included humans. Very few papers mention “movement ecology” in their abstracts, so we did not use “movement ecology” as a search phrase. After much testing, we came up with the following groups of words: Group 1 - Behavior: behavio Group 2 - Movement: movement, moving, motion, spatiotemporal, kinematics, spatio-temporal Group 3 - Biologging: telemetry, geolocat, biologg, accelerom, gps, geo-locat, bio-logg, reorient, vhf, argos, radar, sonar, gls, vms, animal-borne Group 4 - Individuals: animal, individual, human, person, people, player, wildlife, fishermen Paper abstracts had to have words from at least 3 of the groups above to be selected. An initial search revealed these keywords to pick up papers from a variety of fields such as biochemistry, medicine, physics and economics. As such, unless they had words from group 3, paper abstracts could not contain the following words: Group 5 - Missleading words: cell, DNA, enzyme, strain, neurons, atom, molecule, lymph, cortex, cortic, neurotransmi, patient prosthese, eye, particle, tectonic, counsel, cognit, market, spine, questionnaire, sendentary, insulin The search on WoS was made over a final selection of 273 journals; made in parallel with keyword tunning. 2.1.3 Cleaning and filtering results in R The grouping criteria were applied to the Topic field in WoS, which searched the Title, Abstract, and Keywords sections. We downloaded the search results from WoS, which contain information on title, keywords, abstracts and authors, among others. We downloaded all references in raw .txt format as it was the valid input for the refsplitr package available for R (R Core Team (2018)) on github (https://github.com/ropensci/refsplitr) (Fournier et al. (2019)). Refsplitr reads in multiple WoS files, parses addresses, and performs author matching. We used the references_read function to compile the .txt files into one data sheet. To be sure that the papers shown in our search in WoS were respecting our search criteria for the abstracts, we applied the same filters described above to the downloaded search results via R. In addition to the grouping criteria we filtered by Document Type to only allow ‘Articles,’‘Proceedings Papers,’ and ‘Reviews.’ This process yielded 8007 papers. The code can be downloaded here. 2.1.4 Quality control From the cleaned results, we took a random sample of 100 papers (i.e. with title, abstracts and other features taken from WoS). We then read the abstracts and classified them into “mov-eco” and “not mov-eco.” If the percentage of mov-eco papers (i.e. precision) was lower than 80%, the word criterion used for the search would be improved (e.g. adding more words, editing some, changing the rules for the groups). This is how we came up with the groups introduced above (section 2.1). We obtained 90% of precision. That means that, from the papers that we had, almost all of them were mov-eco papers. We also wanted to obtain a recall or sensitivity rate to quantify, from all mov-eco papers in the literature, how many we had in our search results. As it is impossible to obtain the “real” list of mov-eco papers in the literature, we instead looked at the list of papers published by the journal Movement Ecology. We found that 69% were in our list. An estimated sensitivity of 69% and precision of 90% implies that though we did not get the whole population of mov-eco papers in our set, there is a high certainty that those obtained are mov-eco papers. 2.1.5 Possible biases We have no reason to believe that our search criteria have introduced biases to our results. The relatively short list of words is due to the fact that other words we tried were actually reducing our precision, providing us many papers that were not about movement ecology. Of course, it is always possible that we forgot to try an important word. A possible bias could come from WoS: we were not able to get papers that were not in WoS, which depends on WoS agreements. 2.1.6 Differences with other approaches selecting and analyzing mov-eco papers Holyoak et al. (2008): Their goal was to find papers about movement of organisms or gametes, so their definition of movement ecology was somewhat broader than ours. We were inspired by their procedure, and tried the terms that they showed in the paper that would be consistent with our definition of mov-eco. Like us, they used WoS to build their literature dataset. They had a two-step criterion to select the papers. First, they screened the WoS for papers that contained their keywords. Then, they narrowed down the selection by excluding non-ecological journals from their initial results. Two of their coauthors decided on a list of 496 journals. We applied a similar procedure but using a modified set of keywords because we found their criteria to be too broad for our definition, and then two coauthors (R.J. and S.P.) decided on 273 journals. Among the remaining articles, they selected a random sample of 1000 papers for quality control, rating them as relevant or not. Their overall success rate (similar to our precision) was 77%. Fraser et al. (2018): They also used the WoS. In “Topics,” they searched for “ecology” and either “movement,” “migrat,” “home range,” “dispersal” or “track.” Their combination of words was too vague in our opinion, and they did not mention any quality control (e.g. precision, recall, specificity, sensitivity) statistic. 2.2 Downloading whole manuscripts Fig. 2.2. Downloading movement ecology papers. We used the fulltext package (Chamberlain (2019)) in R, using Elsevier, Springer, Scopus, Wiley, BMC and PLOS one API keys. We downloaded the articles we had access to, as xml or pdf documents. We downloaded a total of 4060 complete manuscripts, representing 51% of our list of mov-eco papers. The codes to download papers can be downloaded clicking on this link. 2.3 Extracting the Material and Methods (M&amp;M) sections Fig. 2.3. Summary of procedure to extract Material and Methods section from each paper. For some analyses (section 3), we needed the Material and methods section of the manuscripts. We created codes for .xml (click to download) and .pdf (click to download) files. The former was built using the functions of the xml2 package (Wickham, Hester, and Ooms (2018)). The later calls the readPDF and Corpus functions from the tm (Feinerer and Hornik (2018)) package. In order to write the codes, we took account of the structure of the papers in either format, and aimed at finding section names related to “Methods,” “Data” or “Statistical Analysis.” Not all papers had an M&amp;M section (e.g. reviews or perspective papers). We were able to extract 3674 M&amp;M sections (46% of mov-eco paper results and 90% of fully downloaded papers). The possibility to download articles was conditioned by openness of data from the publishers and data &amp; text mining agreements with the institutions we accessed them from. Fig. 2.4. Number of articles about movement ecology of animals and human mobility identified by our algorithm and per journal. In blue, the number of articles that were downloaded and a methods section was identified. In yellow, the number of articles that were not downloaded.

The solid line and grey area represent the fitted local polynomial regression (estimates and error bounds, respectively). Several dimensions of the mov-eco literature were analyzed: research topics, taxonomical groups studied, components of the movement ecology framework studied, tracking devices used, software tools used, and statistical methods applied. Depending on the dimension, we either analyzed the title, keywords, abstract or material and methods (M&amp;M). The sections used for each aspect of the analysis are detailed in the following table. Dimension Title Keywords Abstract M&amp;M Topics X Taxonomy X X X Framework X X X Devices X X X X Software X X X X Methods X X X X Table 3.2. Paper sections used to analyze each dimension. 3.1 Topic analysis Fig. 3.2. Stages of topic analysis. The topics were not defined a priori. Instead, we fitted Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) models to the abstracts (Blei, Ng, and Jordan (2003)). 3.1.1 The model LDAs are Bayesian mixture models that assume the existence of a fixed number \\(K\\) of topics behind the abstracts. Each topic can be characterized by a multinomial distribution of words with parameter \\(\\beta\\), drawn from a Dirichlet distribution with parameter \\(\\gamma\\). Each document \\(d \\in {1, ..., D}\\) is composed by a mixture of topics, drawn from a multinomial distribution with parameter \\(\\theta\\), which is drawn from a Dirichlet distribution with parameter \\(\\alpha\\). For each word \\(w\\) in document \\(d\\), first a hidden topic \\(z\\) is selected from the multinomial distribution with parameter \\(\\theta\\). From the selected topic \\(z\\), a word is selected based on the multinomial distribution with parameter \\(\\beta\\). The log-likelihood of a document \\(d = \\{w_1,...,w_N\\}\\) is \\(l(\\alpha,\\beta) = \\log(p(d|\\alpha,\\beta)) = \\log\\int\\sum_z\\left[\\prod_{n=1}^{N} p(w_i|z_i,\\beta)p(z_i|\\theta)\\right]p(\\theta|\\alpha)d\\theta\\) Here we used the LDA model with variational EM estimation (Wainwright and Jordan (2008), Blei, Ng, and Jordan (2003)) implemented in the topicmodels package. All the details of the model specification and estimation are in Grün and Hornik (2011). The model assumes exchangeability (i.e. the order of words is negligible), that topics are uncorrelated, and that the number of topics is known. The most commonly used criterion to choose a number of topics is the perplexity score or likelihood of a test dataset (De Waal and Barnard (2008)). Basically, this quantity measures the degree of uncertainty a language model has when predicting some new text (for this study, a new abstract of a paper). Lower values of the perplexity is good and it means the model is assigning higher probabilities. However, the perplexity score measures predictive capacities, rather than having actual humanly-interpretable latent topics (Chang et al. (2009)). In fact, using this score could result in there being too many topics; see Griffiths and Steyvers (2004) who analyzed PNAS abstracts and obtained 300 topics. Hence, we decided to fix the number of topics to 15, as a reasonable value that would not be too large than we could not interpret them, or too small that the topics were too general. Fig. 3.3. Schematic representation of the links between words, documents and topics. Each document is a mixture of topics. Each topic is modeled as a distribution of words. Each word comes out of one of these topics. Source of the image: Blei, D.M. 2012. Probabilistic topic models. Communications of the ACM, 55(4), 77-84. Fig. 3.4. Schematic representation of the Latent Dirichlet model described above. 3.1.2 Preprocessing To improve the quality of our LDA model outputs, we cleaned the data by 1) removing redundant words for identifying topics (e.g. prepositions and numbers), 2) converting all British English words to American English so they would not be seen as different words, 3) lemmatizing (i.e. extracting the lemma of a word based on its intended meaning, with the aim of grouping words under the same lemma) (Ingason et al. (2008)), 4) filtering out words that were only used once in the whole set of abstracts. R packages tidytext (Silge and Robinson (2016)), tm and textstem (Rinker (2018)) were used in this stage (click to download). 3.1.3 Model fitting The parameter estimates of the LDA model were obtained by running 20 replicates of the models (with the VEM estimation method), and keeping the one with the highest likelihood; click here to download the code. 3.1.4 Model outputs From the fitted LDA model, we can obtained: \\(E(\\beta | z,w)\\), as the posterior expected values of word distribution per topic, denoted by \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\), and \\(E(\\theta\\_d | z)\\), the posterior topic distribution per abstract, denoted by \\(\\gamma\\) in the package. The \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\) values were thus a proxy of the importance of a word in a topic. They were used to interpret and label each topic, and to create wordclouds for each topic, where the area occupied by each word was proportional to its \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\) value. Fig. 3.5. Wordclouds of each topic based on \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\) values. Download the codes for the plot here. Since \\(\\gamma\\) indicated the degree of association between an abstract and a topic, we obtained a sample (click to download) of the 5 most associated abstracts to each topic, to aid the interpretation of the topics. Based on these outputs, the topics were interpreted as: 1) Social interactions and dispersal, 2) Movement models, 3) Habitat selection, 4) Detection and data, 5) Home ranges, 6) Aquatic systems, 7) Foraging in marine megafauna, 8) Biomechanics, 9) Acoustic telemetry, 10) Experimental designs, 11) Activity budgets, 12) Avian migration, 13) Sports, 14) Human activity patterns, 15) Breeding ecology. For an extended description of these topics, see the main text of the manuscript. The sum of \\(\\gamma\\) values for each topic (\\(\\sum_d E(\\theta_d | z_k)\\) for each \\(k\\)) served as proxies of the “prevalence” of the topic relative to all other topics and were used to rank them. Fig. 3.6. Measure of prevalence of each topic. Download the codes for the plot here. Fig. 3.7. Time series of the relative prevalence of each topic every year. The code can be downloaded from here. A heatmap of the \\(\\gamma\\) values also showed that most papers were evidently more associated to one topic and few were split into several topics. Fig. 3.8. Heatmap of \\(\\gamma\\) values per abstract and topic. The corresponding code can be downloaded clicking here. 3.1.5 Model assessment We assess the consistency and interpretation of the LDA results via internal and external expert judgement, respectively. 3.1.5.1 Consistency In the heatmap, we showed that most papers were more strongly associated to one topic. To check for consistency, for each topic, we compared its wordcloud with one obtained from abstracts that were highly associated with the topic (\\(\\gamma &gt; 0.75\\)). The two wordclouds should be telling a very similar story, thus visually resemble, with very small differences due to the abstracts being composed –in a small proportion –by other topics as well. We selected the papers with \\(\\gamma &gt; 0.75\\), and computed the number of times each unique word occurred in the abstracts related to the topic. We divided those values by the total number of words in the topic to get a relative frequency \\(\\eta\\). We then created wordclouds for each topic, where the area occupied by each word was proportional to its \\(\\eta\\) value. These wordclouds were overall consistent with the topic wordclouds, i.e. most words were the same, and the words that differ provided complementary information to interpret the topics and understand to which types of abstracts they were strongly associated to. Fig. 3.9. Wordclouds of each topic based on most strongly associated abstracts. The code for this plot can be downloaded clicking here. 3.1.5.2 Interpretation To assess the interpretability of the topics, we performed a word intrusion analysis, i.e. people are given the task to identify a word injected into the top‐terms of each topic. For each topic, we identified the 4 highest-probability words (click to download), i.e. with the highest \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\) values. We did not use a higher number of words in the word intrusion tests as we considered that it could have required more effort from the researchers who kindly and voluntarily participated in this process. Then, we took a high-probability word from another topic –that was not ‘movement’ or ‘behavior’ as they were highly related to most topics –and added it to the group; download file with intruder here. We asked 10 researchers in the field to identify the intruder in each group of words without any more explanations, and suggested them to answer fast so that they would not have to overthink; their answers are here. We then computed the number of correct answers for each topic. A high score for a topic would indicate that the topic was easy to interpret using the 4 highest associated words to it. The scores are shown in the table below. The codes written for this analysis are downloadable clicking here. Topic number Topic label Score (from 0 to 10) 1 Social interactions and dispersal 7 2 Movement models 10 3 Habitat selection 9 4 Detection and data 5 5 Home ranges 8 6 Aquatic systems 8 7 Foraging in marine megafauna 10 8 Biomechanics 0 9 Acoustic telemetry 1 10 Experimental designs 3 11 Activity budgets 2 12 Avian migration 9 13 Sports 0 14 Human activity patterns 5 15 Breeding ecology 4 Table 3.3. Word intrusion score for each topic. Topics 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 and 12 got high scores (&gt;7). A few of the low-scored topics (\\(\\leq 5\\)) had a word intrusion that could be considered relatively general for the researchers thus confusing, such as “tag” (topic 4) and “data” (topics 9 and 15). Moreover, the two topics highly associated with humans, 13 and 14, also had low scores that could be a consequence of the researchers (all ecologists) not expecting any human related group. Overall, this analysis shows that only half of the topics are easily interpretable using the 4 highest-probability words. Even for us, the researchers involved in this study, it was necessary to look at the abstracts with the highest association to each topic in order to be sure of the interpretation of some of the topics. An alternative approach to model assessment in topics is through topic prediction on an independent data set, but this should be performed when the goal of the study is to predict over new data sets, which is not the case here. The word intrusion approach is not an exhaustive assessment of topic interpretability, but it allows putting our results into perspective: some topics have a clear and easy interpretation and some others are really hard to interpret. 3.2 Taxonomical identification To identify the taxonomy of the organisms studied in the papers, the ITIS (Integrated Taxonomic Information System) database (USGS Core Science Analytics and Synthesis) was used to detect names of any animal species (kingdom Animalia) that were mentioned in the abstracts, titles and keywords. We screened these sections for latin and common (i.e., vernacular) names of species (both singular and plural), as well as common names of higher taxonomic levels such as orders and families. We excluded ambiguous terms that are used as common names for taxa but also have a current language meaning; for example: “Here,” “Scales,” “Costa,” “Ray,” etc. Because we wanted to consider humans as a separate category, we excluded “Homo sapiens” from the search terms, but used the following non-ambiguous terms to identify papers that focus on movement ecology of humans: &quot;player&quot;, &quot;players&quot;, &quot;patient&quot;, &quot;patients&quot;, &quot;child&quot;, &quot;children&quot;, &quot;teenager&quot;, &quot;teenagers&quot;, &quot;people&quot;, &quot;student&quot;, &quot;students&quot;, &quot;fishermen&quot;, &quot;person&quot;, &quot;tourist&quot;, &quot;tourists&quot;, &quot;visitor&quot;, &quot;visitors&quot;, &quot;hunter&quot;, &quot;hunters&quot;, &quot;customer&quot;, &quot;customers&quot;, &quot;runner&quot;, &quot;runners&quot;, &quot;participant&quot;, &quot;participants&quot;, &quot;cycler&quot;, &quot;cyclers&quot;, &quot;employee&quot;, &quot;employees&quot;, &quot;hiker&quot;, &quot;hikers&quot;, &quot;athlete&quot;, &quot;athletes&quot;, &quot;boy&quot;, &quot;boys&quot;, &quot;girl&quot;, &quot;girls&quot;, &quot;woman&quot;, &quot;women&quot;, &quot;man&quot;, &quot;men&quot;, &quot;adolescent&quot;, &quot;adolescents&quot;. In cases where words may be suffixes of larger words, we used regular expression notation to exact match words, e.g ‘man’ must match only the word ‘man’ and not ‘manually.’ We excluded words that could have an ambiguous meaning: “passenger” may appear in papers that mention passenger pigeons; “driver” may be used to refer to a causing factor. After having identified any taxon mentioned in a paper, we summarized taxa at the Class level (except for superclasses Osteichthyes and Chondrichthyes which we merged into a single group labeled Fish, and for classes within the phylum Mollusca and the subphylum Crustacea which we considered collectively). Thus, each paper was classified as focusing on one or more class-like groups, as in Holyoak et al. (2008): Fish, Mammals, Birds, Reptiles, Amphibians, Insects, Crustaceans, Mollusks, and others. For the purpose of our analysis, we kept humans as a separate category and did not count them within Class Mammalia. The quality control procedure consisted in selecting a random sample of 100 abstracts and verifying that the common taxonomical group was correctly identified. The accuracy was 93%.

For each topic, relative frequencies of papers studying each taxonomical group. Only papers with more than 50% of association to each topic are used for this graph. The code for plot can be downloaded here. 3.3 Movement ecology framework (MEF) A unifying conceptual framework for movement ecology was proposed in Nathan et al. (2008). It consisted of four components: external factors (i.e. the set of environmental factors that affect movement), internal state (i.e. the inner state affecting motivation and readiness to move), navigation capacity (i.e. the set of traits enabling the individual to orient), and motion capacity (i.e. the set of traits enabling the individual to execute movement). The outcome of the interactions between these four components would be the observed movement path (plus observation errors). To assess the study of the different components of the movement ecology framework, we built what we call here a “dictionary.” A dictionary is composed of concepts and associated words. Here, the concepts of interest were the components of the framework (i.e. internal state, external factor, motion and navigation), and their associated words were the terms potentially used in the abstracts to refer to the study of each component. For example, terms like “memory,” “sensory information,” “path integration” or “orientation” were used to identify the study of navigation. The framework dictionary is downloadable here. To assessed how well the dictionary identified the components in the papers, a quality control procedure was established. For each aspect, a random sample of 100 papers was selected, and a coauthor who did not lead the construction of the dictionary was randomly selected to check if in those papers the categories of the dictionary were correctly identified (i.e. accuracy). The accuracy was 91%. We replicated this analysis for the 1999-2008 period for comparison purposes. 3.3.1 Outputs Component 2009-2018 1999-2008 External factors 77.3% 76.7% Internal state 49.0% 45.7% Motion capacity 26.2% 27.3% Navigation capacity 9.0% 11.7% Table 3.4. Framework components. The values are the percentages of abstracts (where information on the framework was gathered) that use terms related to each component. Fig. 3.13. Representation of the components of the movement ecology framework and how much they were studied in the last decade: external factors, internal state, motion and navigation capacities, whose interactions result in the observed movement path. The size of each component box is proportional to the percentage of papers (in parentheses) tackling them irrespectful of whether they are only about this component or in combination with another one. The latter is specified through the segments that join the components to the observed movement path. One fill color corresponds to papers that only studied one component, while two or more colors correspond to papers that tackled two or three components, respectively (the ones from those colors). The width of the segment is proportional to the percentage of papers that studied that combination (or single component).

These categories were meant to be as monophyletic as possible, and so broad categories had to be defined. Also, use of one technology does not rule out the use of another technology. E.g. radio + GPS is frequently used, and marine studies frequently have an array of sensors on them that may combine multiple technologies. These categories are: Light loggers: Any technology that records light levels and derives locations based on the timing of twilight events. Satellite: Any tag that collects location via, and sends data to, satellites, so that data can be accessed remotely. Frequently, the ARGOS system. Radio telemetry: Any technology that infers location based on radio telemetry (VHF/UHF frequency). Sometimes it is used in addition to either light logger or GPS technology, though this distinction cannot be readily inferred using our methodology. Camera: They include any device that records location/presence via photos or video; mainly camera traps with known locations where the capture of the individual implies the location. Video: They include any device that records movement via video. Acoustic: Any technology that uses sound to infer location, either in a similar way to radio telemetry or in an acoustic array where animal vocalizations are recorded and the location of sensors in the array are used to obtain an animal location. Pressure: Any technology that records pressure readings (frequently in the water), and these changes infer vertical movement, such as through a water column. Accelerometer: Any technology that is placed on a subject and measures the acceleration of the tag, and this delta infers movement. Body conditions: Any technology that uses body condition sensors to collect data on the subject that may be associated with a movement or lack thereof, such as temperature and heart rate. GPS: Any technology that uses Global Position System satellites to calculate the location of an object. Can be handheld GPS devices, or animal-borne tags. Radar: Any technology that uses “radio detection and ranging” devices to track objects. Can be large weather arrays or tracking radars. Encounter: Any analog tracking method where the user must capture the subject and place a marker on the subject. The recapturing/resighting of the subject infers the movement. This category was difficult to capture in our study due to a lack of specific phrases that can be used. Their use was assessed with a dictionary approach. The dictionary can be downloaded here. To assess how well the dictionary identified the types of devices in the papers, a quality control procedure was established. For each aspect, a random sample of 100 papers was selected, and a coauthor who did not lead the construction of the dictionary was randomly selected to check if in those papers the categories of the dictionary were correctly identified (i.e. accuracy). The accuracy was 84%. To assess if we were identifying animal-borne GPS rather than hand-held GPS, we took a sample of 100 papers already associated to GPS according to our dictionary. 83 referred to GPS tags, 12 were hand held, and 5 were neither tag nor hand-held (e.g. GPS coordinates in general, or General Practitioners). 3.4.1 Output Fig. 3.17. Proportion of papers in each year using the five most commonly used tracking devices. A study can use more than one device, hence the proportions for each year can sum up to more than one. The code for plot can be downloaded here. 3.5 Software Here we also used a dictionary approach. We used expert opinion to compile all known software used in movement ecology. The 33 software in our list were 1) R, 2) Python, 3) SPSS, 4) Matlab, 5) SAS, 6) MARK (program Mark and not R package unmarked), 7) Java, 8) C (if researchers wrote C code themselves; i.e some tracking Radars for pre-processing), 9) Fortran, 10) WinBUGS, 11) Agent-Analyst, 12) BASTrack, 13) QGIS, 14) GRASS, 15) Microsoft Excel, 16) Noldus observer, 17) fragstats, 18) postgis (we separated postGIS from the database category because its high spatial analytical capabilities), 19) databases (any relational database, likely for data management and summarizing necessarily for analyitical use), 20) e-surge, 21) m-surge, 22) u-care, 23) Genstat, 24) Biotas, 25) Statview, 26) Primer-e, 27) PAST, 28) STATA, 29) Statistica, 30) UCINET, 31) Mathcad, 32) Vicon, and 33) GME (geospatial modeling environment). The dictionary with the terms used can be downloaded here. For quality control, we examined a random sample of 50 papers. The accuracy was 88%. 3.5.1 Output Fig. 3.18. Proportion of papers in each year using the five most commonly used software. A study can use more than one software, hence the proportions for each year can sum up to more than one. The code for plot can be downloaded here. 3.6 Statistical methods Within our dictionary approach, we first used expert opinion to compile all known statistical methods (and terms used for them) that could have been used in movement ecology, resulting in 188 terms; click here to download the corresponding file. We classified statistical methods into Spatial, Time-series, Movement, Spatiotemporal, Social, and Generic. Their definitions are below: Spatial: spatial statistical methods (e.g. geostatistics) Time-series: time series methods (e.g. functional data analysis) Movement: statistical method used for the study of movement (e.g. behavioral change point analysis) Spatiotemporal: spatiotemporal but not movement methods (e.g. spatiotemporal geostatistics) Social: statistical methods that are not exclusively for movement, but that characterize or model social processes (e.g. social networks) Generic: generic statistical methods that could be used in any type of study, that are not inherently spatial, temporal or social (e.g. a regression analysis) Terms related to hypothesis tests were first considered but ultimately removed; we considered that the tendency of papers to present p-values could be biasing researchers towards the use of hypothesis tests, thus creating a bias towards general methods. For quality control, we examined a random sample of 50 papers. The accuracy was 84%. 3.6.1 Outputs Fig. 3.19. Proportion of papers in each year mentioning each type of statistical method. A study can use more than one type of method, hence the proportions for each year can sum up to more than one.

The exact formulation of the questions in the survey can be downloaded here. 4.2 Participation in the survey The survey was designed to be completely anonymous. There was no previous selection of the participants and no probabilistic sampling was involved. The survey was advertised by mailing lists (r-sig-geo and r-sig-ecology), individual emails to researchers, the lab’s website https://mablab.org, the Gordon Research Conference and Seminar on Movement Ecology of Animals, and Twitter. It took place during the Winter/Spring of 2019. The survey got exemption from the Institutional Review Board at University of Florida (IRB02 Office, Box 112250, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611-2250). A total of 82 people participated in the survey, and 61 answered at least one question concerning the field (and not just their years of experience in research or the field). No question was mandatory, so participants could opt to not answer some questions. We first asked the participants how many years they have been doing research, and how many years they have been working on animal movement. They have spent a median of 10 years in research, and a median of 6 years in animal movement. 4.3 Movement ecology framework In a 2008 article, “A movement ecology paradigm for unifying organismal movement research,” Nathan et al. defined a movement ecology framework where the movement propagation process is produced by the motion and the navigation processes, with internal and external factors affecting movement. We asked the participants: Would you say that most research articles in movement ecology analyze these components of the movement ecology framework? Would you say that the these components of the movement ecology framework are currently being more, less or equally studied compared to 10 years ago? The results are shown in the graphs below. Most participants perceived that external factors are being addressed in most movement ecology papers, that motion is being addressed in at least half of the literature, and that navigation and external factors are addressed in less than half. Interestingly, when asked which components were most studied now than 10 years ago, most participants agreed on internal factors. 4.4 Taxa We asked the participants which taxa they considered to be studied the most in movement ecology, and to select up to 3 taxa. The number of votes per taxon are shown in the graph below. Birds and then mammals were indicated as the most studied. 4.5 Tracking devices We asked the participants the following questions: Which tracking device do you consider to be used the most in movement ecology? (up to 3) Which tracking devices do you think are used more often now compared to 10 years ago? (up to 3) Which tracking devices do you think are used less often now compared to 10 years ago? (up to 3) The results are shown in the graphs above. GPS and satellite tags (e.g. PSAT, PTT) are the most used devices, according to the participants. When compared to 10 years ago, they expressed that accelerometers and GPS devices are more used than before, while radio tags and encounter techniques (e.g. capture mark recapture, banding, direct observation) are less used. 4.6 Software We asked the participants the following questions: Which software do you think is used the most for movement analysis? (up to 3) For movement analysis, which software do you think are used more often now compared to 10 years ago? (up to 3) For movement analysis, which software do you think are used less often now compared to 10 years ago? (up to 3) The results are shown in the graphs above. R, and in the a lesser degree, ArcGIS, are the most used software, according to the participants. When compared to 10 years ago, they expressed that R is more used than before, while Matlab, ArcGIS, SPSS and SAS are less used. 4.7 Methods We asked the participants the following questions: Which statistical/mathematical methods do you consider to be used the most for movement analysis? Which methods do you think are used more often now compared to 10 years ago? (up to 3) Which methods do you think are used less often now compared to 10 years ago? (up to 3) There are many analytical tools applied/developed in movement ecology. To keep it simple, we provided the participants with 9 (arbitrarily selected) options: generalized linear models (GLMs) and generalized additive models (GAMs), machine learning, model selection criteria, multivariate exploratory methods, net squared displacement (NSD), spatial point processes, state-space and Hidden Markov models (SSMs and HMMs, respectively), step and resource selection functions (SSFs and RSFs, respectively), and test statistics and p-values. We provided an “Other” option for researchers to indicate methods that would not be within the 9 other options. In the end, the “Other” option was poorly used. The results are shown in the graphs above. The most used methods in movement ecology, according to the participants, are SSFs and RSFs, SSMs and HMMs, GLMs and GAMs. When compared to 10 years ago, they expressed that SSMs and HMMs, as well as machine learning, and in a lesser degree, SSFs and RSFs are more used, while hypothesis tests are less used. The “Other” option was used for speed threshold (1) and mininum convex polygon and kernel density utilization (1), for the first question; visual analytics (1), and continuous time movement modeling (1) for the second question; descriptive metrics (1) and “none” (1) for the third. 4.8 Big changes in the field We asked the participants three final open questions. In your opinion, what has revolutionized the field in the last 10 years? (Please keep it to three topics) 33 participants answered this first question. 31 answers were related to tagging devices (smaller, long-lasting, cheaper, battery-saving devices) that gave rise to longer or higher resolution data on many species. 15 answers were related to software development and computational power, 6 to statistical methods, 2 to the availability of remote sensing data, 2 to availability of tracking data online (in open data portals like movebank), 1 to molecular markers, 1 to citizen science, and there were other references to “mechanistic thinking and approaches” (1), the increase in the number of studies (1) and Nathan et al. 2008 paper in PNAS (1). Compared to 10 years ago, what would you be able to work on now that you could not do 10 years ago? (Please keep it to three topics; your answer may involve taxa, devices, methods or others) 29 participants answered this question. 28 answers were related to tagging devices that allowed working with smaller species, obtaining longer datasets, tracking more individuals and having high resolution data on their movement; among them, 4 mentioned the opportunity to work with accelerometry data. 5 answers were related to working with environmental data to link to the movement data (one mentioned it to do habitat selection analysis), 4 people mentioned studies in physiology, 3 of behavior, 3 of movement models and analysis in general, 1 studies on the mechanisms underlying movement, 1 multitaxa comparison, 1 citizen science thanks to apps on the phone. 2 people mentioned computational simulation and 2 processing data. In your opinion, what will revolutionize the field in the next 10 years? (Please keep it to three topics) 32 participants answered this question. 21 gave answers related to tagging devices (including use of ICARUS technology, 3D monitoring, development of more reliable and less invasive devices, improvement of accelerometers, and combined use of devices). 5 people referred to the development of statistical and mathematical methods to study movement processes (including machine learning techniques); 3 mentioned the availability of high resolution remote sensing data; 2 answers were related to software and computing power, 2 to connecting movement ecology to physiology, 2 to evolution, 1 to ontogeny, 1 to large-scale navigation experiments, 1 to integrating navigation, genetics, environment, physiology, life history and population dynamic studies; 1 to the development of data platforms, and 1 to “improved conceptualization of the field.” 4.9 Summary Most participants in the survey had less than a decade of experience in the field, so their farthest point of comparison in the past is from less than 10 years. Participants identified external factors as the dominant component in movement ecology papers, though recognizing that there is an increasing but still weaker interest in the link between internal factors and movement. Birds and mammals were identified as the most studied taxa in the field. GPS tags were identified as the most used tags, while the use of accelerometers is increasing and the use of radio tags, decreasing. The R software is the most used software according to the participants, and it is far more used than 10 years ago. On the other hand, Matlab, ArcGIS, SPSS and SAS use have decreased in the last decade. RSFs, SSFs, SSMs, HMMs, as well as GLMs and GAMs, are the most used statistical methods in movement ecology. SSM, HMM and machine learning techniques have experienced a notable increase in their use in the last decade, while the use of statistical tests, mainly, have decreased. When asked for what has revolutionized the field and what will play a major role in the next 10 years, most of the answers were related to tracking devices (miniaturization, reliability, battery saving, combined use of them). In a lesser degree, software, data and methods to analyze movement were mentioned. Most participants identified tracking technology as the game changer in the field.
