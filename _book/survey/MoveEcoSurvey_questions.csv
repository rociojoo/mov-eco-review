"QID1","Q1","Thank you for taking the time to participate. The purpose of this survey is to assess the perspective of movement ecologists on their own field. We want to understand where the field of movement ecology is right now, what has changed in the past 10 years, and what is expected to be a game-changer in the next 10 years.
  
The survey will only take 10-15 minutes to complete. The questions are about your opinion of the field, so you could answer what you think from the top of your head or take more time to think about them; it is up to you. It is OK if you do not know the entire field of movement ecology. Try to be as broad as you can when you answer, but it is fine if your answers are biased towards your particular experience. We are asking for opinions so there is no correct answer. 

The survey is completely anonymous, and no personal information is collected. However, you can also decide to temporarily save your results to finish the survey later, in which case you can use a nickname to keep your answers anonymous. And, of course, at any given moment, you can decide to leave the survey. This is completely voluntary.

This survey will be open until March 30th. For additional information on this survey, you can contact Rocío Joo at rocio.joo@ufl.edu. You can subscribe to a mailing list for news about this survey and review here.

"QID5","Q5","In a 2008 article, “A movement ecology paradigm for unifying organismal movement research”, Nathan et al. defined a movement ecology framework where the movement propagation process is produced by the motion and the navigation processes, with internal and external factors affecting movement. 

Would you say that most research articles in movement ecology analyze these components of the movement ecology framework?
